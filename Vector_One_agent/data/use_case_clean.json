    "qa_consolidated": "Project Summary: Describe the key business problem(s) or opportunity this project addresses. Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: Project Summary\n\nCompany 1 is pioneering a new model of sustainable living powered by AI, XR, robotics, and digital twin technology. Traditional housing models are wasteful, static, and disconnected from both the environment and the emerging tools that can make living spaces smarter, cleaner, and more adaptable. There is a growing demand for homes and communities that are sustainable, tech-enabled, and future-proof.\n\nOur solution creates modular, eco-conscious living spaces designed and operated through immersive XR and AI platforms. Using digital twin technology, residents can visualize, customize, and simulate their home environments before they are built. Once deployed, every space integrates robotics, automation, and AI-driven controls, allowing individuals to manage lighting, climate, energy production, water systems, and security all remotely from anywhere in the world.\n\nThe global modular housing market is projected to surpass $140B by 2030, and XR/AI adoption is forecast to exceed $200B. Company 1 positions itself at the intersection of these movements, targeting environmentally conscious individuals, forward-thinking families, and innovators seeking to live smarter, cleaner, and more sustainably.\n\nThis project will demonstrate how immersive design, agentic AI, and digital twins can reimagine not only housing but the future of living itself. Beyond business, Company 1 is a movement teaching the world to embrace sustainable, intelligent lifestyles that merge technology, community, and clean living.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: Key Objectives and Success Milestones\n\nThe key objective of Company 1’s solution is to create a new model of sustainable, intelligent living by integrating AI, XR, robotics, and digital twin technology into modular eco-homes. Our goals are to:\n\nBuild a new product: Develop a proof-of-concept modular home with full XR/AI-enabled design, digital twin simulation, and remote control of all integrated systems (energy, water, climate, lighting, and security).\n\nImprove decision support: Empower individuals and communities to visualize and customize sustainable living spaces before construction, using generative AI and digital twins to optimize layouts, energy efficiency, and resource use.\n\nAutomate processes: Incorporate robotics and AI-driven automation to reduce waste, improve maintenance, and streamline daily living operations.\n\nEstablish scalability: Demonstrate a replicable model that can scale globally as a blueprint for sustainable, tech-enabled communities.\n\nSuccess Milestones\n\nCompletion of the digital twin platform for immersive design and simulation.\n\nDeployment of a prototype modular unit with integrated AI/robotics control systems.\n\nValidation of energy and resource efficiency improvements versus traditional housing.\n\nPilot testing with early adopters, generating measurable data on user satisfaction, sustainability outcomes, and cost efficiency.\n\nImportance and Consequences of Delay\nWithout this project, individuals and communities will remain tied to outdated, unsustainable housing models that waste resources and fail to leverage emerging AI/XR capabilities. Delaying implementation means missing a critical opportunity to prove that housing can be both sustainable and intelligent, widening the gap between environmental urgency and technological adoption. It would also slow Canada’s leadership in sustainable AI/XR innovation at a time when global demand for clean, tech-enabled living is accelerating.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project?

(e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): Yes, there are several ethical, legal, and societal considerations we are actively addressing in this project:\n\nFairness & Bias: Generative AI and LLMs can reflect biases present in training data. We will mitigate this through curated, diverse datasets and human-in-the-loop validation to ensure recommendations (e.g., for design, sustainability, or hospitality services) are inclusive and equitable.\n\nData Privacy & Security: Smart modular homes, hotels, and XR environments involve sensitive user data (energy usage, preferences, behavior). We will apply privacy-by-design principles, anonymization, and strict compliance with Canadian and international data regulations (e.g., GDPR, PIPEDA).\n\nTransparency & User Trust: Users must understand how AI is influencing recommendations or controlling devices. We will integrate explainable AI features, dashboards, and transparent logging of system actions to build user confidence.\n\nAutonomy vs. Human Oversight: While agentic AI can manage environments autonomously (e.g., energy optimization, robotics coordination), human override and consent will always be prioritized. Users will maintain full control of their spaces and data.\n\nSustainability & Societal Impact: Our use of AI is directly tied to reducing environmental impact by optimizing energy use, material selection, and lifecycle management. This aligns with global sustainability goals, ensuring AI deployment is a net positive for society and the planet.\nHow will you measure success for this project?

    "qa_consolidated": "Project Summary: Describe the key business problem(s) or opportunity this project addresses. Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: company 2 is an AI-driven mapping company. Our core product, RealSimE, is a cloud-based SAS platform that automates the generation of simulation-ready HD maps for Autonomous Driving (AD) and Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). The business challenge we are addressing is the cost, complexity, and manual effort involved in creating simulation environments at scale—an issue that limits both safety validation and rapid deployment in the autonomous systems sector.\n\nThe opportunity is rooted in the urgent market need for scalable, realistic, and customizable simulation environments. The global simulation market for AD/ADAS is expected to exceed USD $10B by 2030, driven by increasingly stringent regulatory and safety validation requirements. Our target audience includes automotive OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, simulation platform providers, and governments/regulators. These stakeholders require high-fidelity environments to test driving policy, edge cases, and control logic—especially in dynamic, unstructured urban settings.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: The primary objective of this project is to integrate Agentic AI into RealSimE, our simulation-ready HD mapping platform, to optimize accuracy, scalability, and interactivity. By deploying domain-specific agents, we aim to automate four key components in the simulation map creation process:\n\t1. Geometry corrections: auto-adjusting geometry and topology to fit real-world constraints.\n\t2. Semantics: enriching maps with contextual annotations like road rules and asset types.\n\t3. QA/QC Validation:  identifying and correcting inconsistencies in geometry or metadata.\n\t4. Edge Case Scenario Generation: creating synthetic, high-risk scenes for robust AV/ADAS testing.\n\nMajor milestone: \n\t•\tMVP deployment of multi-agent orchestration for map QA/QC \nIf this project is delayed or not implemented, RealSimE risks falling behind industry expectations for automation and interactivity. Agentic automation is essential to meet these market demands, reduce operational bottlenecks, and maintain our competitive advantage as a next-generation simulation-enablement platform.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool. Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: We envision three main deliverables resulting from this project, all aimed at advancing RealSimE into an agent-assisted simulation platform for AV/ADAS development. Specific outputs may include:\n\t1.\tAutonomous Agent Framework:\nA modular backend system with domain-specific AI agents capable of handling tasks such as semantic QA, scene editing validation, and edge-case generation.\n\t2.\tScene Intelligence API:\nAn internal or public-facing API that allows automated or user-queried semantic map assessments, such as detecting missing elements (e.g., crosswalks, signage) or generating suggestions for scene completion.\n\t3.\tEdge Case Scenario Generator Module:\nA tool that leverages agentic decision-making to synthesize high-risk driving situations (e.g., jaywalking VRUs at unmarked intersections)\nWho will be the primary users of this solution? Please identify key internal or external user groups (e.g., analysts, customers, clinicians, etc.).: Internal Users: \t•\tGIS Developers – Validate and format simulation-ready maps with increased automation and speed. \t•\tCartographers / Annotation Specialists – Benefit from AI-assisted semantic labeling and reduced manual workload. \t•\tSoftware Developers – Integrate domain-specific agents into RealSimE’s backend, streamlining workflows.  External Users: \t•\tSimulation Engineers at Tier 1 Suppliers – Customize, test, and iterate scenes faster for AV/ADAS development. \t•\tQA Teams at OEMs and Tier 1s – Perform automated quality checks to ensure scalable, accurate simulation map deployment.\nHow will this solution integrate with your existing operations or product offerings?: New standalone tool or feature\nPlease describe the dataset(s) you intend to use for this project.: Dataset Content & Relevance\nThis project does not rely on image-based datasets. Instead, we will use internal geometric vector map datasets from our RealSimE platform. These maps are structured representations of road networks including lanes, intersections, signs, and traffic elements. The goal is to evaluate these maps against predefined simulation standards using AI agents—to detect errors (e.g., disconnected lanes, missing signals) and recommend scenarios for validation. This is highly relevant for automating quality control and test generation in AD/ADAS simulation workflows.\nSource of the Dataset\nThe data comes from company 2’s internal simulation mapping pipeline. For this project, only the final vector map layers will be used—no aerial imagery or annotations are required.\nWhat is the current state of readiness of this dataset?: Fully labeled for ML tasks\nDoes the dataset contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII): False\nPlease describe how PII is handled or anonymized:: \nHow do you plan to evaluate the model or system’s performance?: To ensure the reliability and effectiveness of Agentic AI integration in RealSimE, we will use a multi-pronged evaluation approach:\n\n Golden Dataset for QA Validation\n\nWe will create a small set of manually verified simulation maps representing ideal geometries and standards. These “golden” maps will serve as a benchmark for validating the agent’s ability to detect geometry inconsistencies, identify violations, and propose corrections.\n\n Heuristic Rules Based on Simulation Standards\n\nAgents will operate on embedded business rules and heuristics derived from domain-specific simulation guidelines (e.g., valid lane connectivity, presence of required traffic control elements). Evaluation will include accuracy in rule compliance and the rate of false positives/negatives.\n\nPre/Post Comparison of Edge Case Generation\n\nTo assess the agent’s impact on scenario generation, we will compare edge case coverage before and after agent integration:\n\t•\tNumber of edge cases generated per map\n\t•\tNovelty and diversity of cases\n\t•\tTime-to-generate edge cases\n\nHuman-in-the-Loop Verification\n\nCartographers and simulation engineers will review agent recommendations via a visual dashboard. Feedback will be used to:\n\t•\tScore agent outputs (e.g., correct, incorrect, uncertain)\n\t•\tFine-tune agent behavior\n\t•\tTrack agreement rates over time\n\nPerformance Metrics & Dashboards\n\nSuccess indicators will be monitored through internal dashboards showing:\n\t•\tReduction in QA/QC processing time (baseline vs. agent-assisted)\n\t•\tNumber of manual interventions required\n\t•\tAgent recall and precision in error detection\n\t•\tScene completion rates\nHave you already explored or are you considering techniques associated with Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for this use case? If so, please specify which specific models or approaches used or are under consideration.: No, we have not yet explored or implemented Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for this use case. While we are aware of their potential, our current focus is on developing domain-specific agentic systems based on structured simulation standards and rule-based reasoning, rather than using generative models or LLMs.\nAre there any ethical, legal, or societal considerations related to the use of Generative AI or autonomous agents in this context? (e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): No, we do not anticipate any ethical, legal, or societal concerns at this stage, as the system does not process personal data or sensitive user information. The autonomous agents will operate within clearly defined rule-based parameters derived from simulation standards, minimizing risks related to bias, fairness, or transparency.\nHow will you measure success for this project? Please include any baseline metrics, KPIs, or qualitative outcomes you hope to observe.: We will measure success through a combination of quantitative KPIs and qualitative feedback from internal and external stakeholders.\n\nKey Metrics & Baseline Comparison\n\t•\tQA/QC Efficiency:\nBaseline: 100% manual validation.\nTarget: ≥50% reduction in human time spent on geometry validation tasks.\n\t•\tSemantic Labeling Automation:\nBaseline: Fully manual annotation by cartographers.\nTarget: Automate ≥60% of semantic layer generation using agents.\n\t•\tScenario Generation Time:\nBaseline: Several hours of manual review and scene crafting.\nTarget: Generate valid edge-case scenarios in under 10 minutes using agentic queries.\nWhat infrastructure or platforms do you plan to use to support the development of this project?: Amazon Web Services (AWS)\nIn one or two sentences, describe the ideal MLA candidate for this project.: The ideal candidate for this project would have experience with autonomous agents, rule-based validation systems, and simulation data workflows. Familiarity with geospatial data structures, QA automation, and integration of intelligent agents into complex pipelines (e.g., for scene editing or semantic reasoning) is highly desirable.

Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).\nOur organization trains nurses and pharmacists for their licensing exams. We wish to create tools for managing, improving and revising large volumes of questions -- which is a significant problem in the medical education space.\n\nThe reason for this problem are manifold\n\nRECENT TRENDS FORCE INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN LARGE INVENTORIES OF QUESTIONS\n\n\nThis is true for a variety of reasons: (1) computer adaptive tests (CATs), where the difficulty of the test changes while you do the test are increasingly being used. But in a CAT if the student sees 75 questions and you have 10 possible difficulty levels, you need 750 questions (2) many institutions and standardized tests allow students to do tests at home using their own computers; but even with remote proctoring, the questions are considered compromised when used, necessitating new ones to take their place (3) owing to changes in the nursing and pharmacy exams,  many new questions need to be created. For example, in the nursing licensing exam they have 23 different types of questions with multiple choice being just 1 of them, with 13 of those types never seen before in any other test (which means institutions cannot previously have a supply of them); and (4) some US states have laws against standardized exams from external vendors (as the reused questions are considered compromised) necessitating institutions to create their own questions.\n\nTHESE LARGE QUESTION BANKS BECOME UNWIELDY TO MAINTAIN\nIn medicine nothing is static. The way a disease is supposed to be treated is defined by clinical practice guidelines which tend to continually change. In an average month 2 to 5 clinical practice guidelines will change and this necessitates changes to course notes, questions, flashcards and other educational materials. In addition the needs of exams change in a phenomenon some call “drift” whereby the exam makers will gradually make changes such as raising the level of difficulty or the level of thinking required (as classified by a theory called “Bloom’s taxonomy”). But when these changes happen there comes a need to review all questions to make sure they conform with these changes.\n\nPURPOSE OF PROJECT AND OPPORTUNITY\n\nThe purpose of this project is to create a tool for college and university faculty as well as standardized testing agencies to identify which questions need to be changed, and to help them implement those changes and to improve those questions for better student outcomes. \n\nAmong the criteria the system will use to identify questions that are candidate for change are (1) conformance to a learning objectives, (2) clarity (3) fairness (e.g. one clear answer) (4) non-obvious answers (5) conform to the latest clinical guidelines (6) conformance with exam formatting and other exam requirements (6) are tagged correctly according to a hierarchical taxonomy (7) test the right level of thinking (as classified by Bloom’s Taxonomy). \n\nOnce a question has been identified that it needs to be changed, recommended actions will be provided to the user on how to improve the question. Additionally the human can direct the AI to change certain aspects of a question; for instance, by  highlighting an answer choice and indicating to the AI that the answer choice is “too obvious” to rework the question to make the answer choice less obvious. Additionally, the tool will identify gaps in the questions to achieve the hierarchical curriculum learning objectives (e.g. by reporting that “there is no question that tests this aspect of your curriculum”)\n\nCurrently no such tool exists in the market, and human judgement alone is being relied on. This tool will assist humans to become at least 10 times more productive by approving the AI’s recommendations while also directing the AI (for example, by highlighting a question choice and indicating to the AI that the answer choice is too obvious, and requesting that it be re-written).\n\nMARKET SIZE\n\nNurses in Canada and the USA share a common licensing exam called the NCLEX. The market size for nursing licensing exam prep is estimated to be over USD $418 million and has grown between 9.5% (2023) to 15% (2022) annually (the 2 latest years available) and is expected to accelerate as existing nurses are mass-retiring and governments are making investments to increase nursing enrollment to make up for the gap. The nursing education market is estimated to be $6.8 billion annually, and this would be a segment of that. The pharmacy licensing exam prep market is estimated to be $74 million in Canada and the USA growing at about 15% annually.\n\nPAST PROJECT\n\n\nThis work builds on our past work in:\n\n\nAutomated question writing and associated patents\nPast Vector MLA (as part of cohort 8) that resulted in a working remediation system and patent application \nIdentifying strengths and weaknesses\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: Build a prototype that will result in a new product. If this product is not implemented students will not have optimal outcomes and faculty will simply not be able to manage their inventories of questions (which often number in the thousands to tens of thousands).\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool. Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: We envision a prototype being built that via API accesses our existing inventory of 15,000 questions, download the clinical practice guidelines and to write a series of \"detectors\". Each detector will detect a if a specific issue (for instance, non-conformance with the latest clinical treatment guidelines) is present in a question, explain the reason, and the suggested change (similar to how a spelling or grammar check helps a person quickly become aware of changes needed to a document, but the type of changes and issues detected would be much broader). A question may have many reasons necessitating that it be updated. These reasons form the basis for prioritizing which questions need to be changed first. This project would result in the full gamut of identify and fixing and result in a user interface suitable for use by faculty.\nWho will be the primary users of this solution? Please identify key internal or external user groups (e.g., analysts, customers, clinicians, etc.).: College and university faculty and our own internal use at company 3 and NurseAchieve\nHow will this solution integrate with your existing operations or product offerings?: Enhancement to an existing system\nPlease describe the dataset(s) you intend to use for this project.: 1. QUESTIONS\n\nWe have a bank of 15,000 questions in pharmacy and nursing.

    "qa_consolidated": "Project Summary: Describe the key business problem(s) or opportunity this project addresses. Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: company 4 is tackling a major trust and product-discovery gap in the direct-to-consumer (DTC) e-commerce industry, a market projected to exceed $250 B globally by 2026. Today, authentic product reviews are locked inside individual Shopify and DTC storefronts, fragmented and inconsistent in quality. Shoppers struggle to confidently compare products across brands, while independent merchants pay rising acquisition costs to compete with the recommendation engines of dominant marketplaces like Amazon.\n\nOur opportunity is to create the first cross-brand review search engine powered by Generative and Agentic AI. company 4 aggregates millions of customer reviews, applies retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and multi-agent reasoning to summarize sentiment and surface trusted product recommendations in a conversational interface.\n\nTarget users are online shoppers seeking authentic guidance and DTC merchants who need a new, high-trust discovery channel. By enabling transparent, data-driven product discovery, company 4 lowers acquisition costs for brands and gives consumers a trusted, AI-native alternative to closed marketplace ecosystems.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: The primary objective is to build and validate a cross-brand review intelligence engine that transforms fragmented Shopify and DTC reviews into trusted, AI-generated product recommendations. Our goals include:\n\nAutomate unstructured review analysis – convert millions of raw customer reviews into structured sentiment insights using RAG and agentic multi-agent reasoning.\n\nDeliver a conversational discovery experience – enable shoppers to query for the “most recommended” products across brands with explainable, transparent AI responses.\n\nProvide brands with actionable analytics – surface competitive sentiment and category trends to reduce acquisition costs and improve product strategy.\n\nSuccess Milestones\n\nCompletion of a production-ready proof of concept demonstrating real-time retrieval and multi-agent recommendation.\n\nPilot launch with a select group of Shopify merchants and at least 1,000 active consumer queries.\n\nDocumented uplift in shopper trust and measurable decrease in brand customer acquisition cost.\n\nIf this project is delayed, small independent DTC brands remain disadvantaged, forced to rely on expensive ad networks and opaque marketplaces, while shoppers continue to face information overload and unreliable reviews, leaving a growing gap for trusted, AI-driven commerce discovery.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool. Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: Building on the proof of concept successfully developed in the Vector Institute’s DaRMoD Cohort 5—where we completed data readiness, model development, and model deployment—our FastLane project will focus on taking the next step from prototype to a scalable, real-time platform. Key deliverables include:\n\nFunctional prototype enhancement: Expand the existing Streamlit conversational search interface into a production-grade experience that supports broader categories of DTC products, higher query volumes, and seamless integration with the company 4 Reviews Shopify app.\n\nReal-time review data access: Create a live data pipeline that continuously ingests and updates customer reviews across Shopify-powered online stores, ensuring up-to-the-minute product insights and recommendations.\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline: Harden the backend for large-scale ingestion, de-duplication, and multi-agent reasoning to produce trustworthy, explainable product recommendations.\n\nSpecialized Small Language Model (SLM): Lay the foundation for a domain-specific SLM purpose-built for review collection and search chatbots, enabling scalable deployment across the wider DTC e-commerce landscape beyond Shopify.\n\nAnalytics dashboard/API: Provide DTC merchants with live competitive sentiment analytics and actionable insights.\n\nWe expect the Machine Learning Associates (MLAs) to drive development of the real-time ingestion layer, assist in early SLM architecture experiments, and optimize the RAG infrastructure and evaluation metrics to ensure accuracy, scalability, and trustworthiness for commercial rollout.\nWho will be the primary users of this solution? Please identify key internal or external user groups (e.g., analysts, customers, clinicians, etc.).: * Online Shoppers (External) – Consumers looking for trusted, cross-brand product recommendations. They will use company 4’s conversational search interface to quickly compare products and understand authentic sentiment across multiple DTC brands.  * DTC Merchants & Shopify Store Owners (External) – Independent e-commerce brands seeking greater product visibility and actionable insights. They will access the company 4 Reviews Shopify app and accompanying analytics dashboard to monitor competitive sentiment, track their own review performance, and engage new customers through company 4’s discovery engine.  * Internal Product & Data Teams (Internal) – company 4’s own engineers and data scientists, who will maintain the real-time review ingestion pipeline, fine-tune the specialized Small Language Model (SLM), and ensure the quality and reliability of AI-generated recommendations.  These user groups collectively drive the marketplace effect—shoppers benefit from transparent recommendations while merchants gain a high-trust acquisition channel—forming the core ecosystem company 4 aims to scale.\nHow will this solution integrate with your existing operations or product offerings?: Enhancement to an existing system\nPlease describe the dataset(s) you intend to use for this project.: - Content & Relevance:\nIn our initial proof of concept (completed in Vector’s DaRMoD Cohort 5), we utilized a recent Amazon reviews dataset focused on the Beauty products category to validate our retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and multi-agent reasoning approach. These reviews provided authentic, large-scale customer sentiment data—directly relevant to building a cross-brand product-recommendation engine.\n\n- Sources:\nThe dataset was drawn from publicly available Amazon product review corpora (Beauty category) and processed in compliance with data-use terms. For the FastLane project we will expand our training corpus to include reviews from 5–7 major e-commerce categories (e.g., Beauty, Home, Electronics, Apparel, Health & Wellness, Sports, and Pet Supplies).\n\n- Collection Method & Format:\nData is acquired from open Amazon review datasets and stored in structured JSON/CSV format with raw text fields for review bodies and metadata.\n\n- Key Features / Fields\n*Review text and review title\n*Star rating and average product rating\n*Product and category metadata (name, SKU, category)\n*Review timestamp and language\n*Helpful vote (Yes/No) and Verified purchase (Yes/No)\n*Reviews count per product\n*Anonymized reviewer identifier (non-PII)\n\n- Approximate Size:\nThe next training phase targets at least ~350 million reviews across these categories (hundreds of GB of text and metadata).\n\nThis expansion will enable multi-category model training and lay the foundation for a specialized Small Language Model (SLM) to power cross-category review discovery and review-search chatbots.\nWhat is the current state of readiness of this dataset?: Partially annotated\nDoes the dataset contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII): False\nPlease describe how PII is handled or anonymized:: \nHow do you plan to evaluate the model or system’s performance?: To ensure both technical accuracy and real-world impact, we will use a multi-layered evaluation approach that leverages agentic AI to scale search testing:\n\n- Golden Dataset & Benchmarking – Maintain a held-out “golden set” of Amazon and Shopify reviews, manually labeled for sentiment, category, and key product attributes. This benchmark will drive precision/recall, F1 score, and ranking-quality assessments.\n\n- Agentic AI–Driven Search Testing – Deploy autonomous AI agents to simulate diverse shopper queries and automatically test retrieval quality across millions of reviews. These agents continuously probe the system, stress-testing real-time search and recommendation accuracy at scale.\n\n- Human-in-the-Loop Validation – Domain experts and pilot DTC merchants will review AI-generated summaries and recommendations for factual accuracy, bias, and clarity.\nHave you already explored or are you considering techniques associated with Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for this use case? If so, please specify which specific models or approaches used or are under consideration.: Yes. company 4 has already explored and implemented multiple Generative AI and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques in developing our review-intelligence platform. During the Vector DaRMoD Cohort 5, we successfully built and deployed a proof of concept using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agentic AI workflows to summarize and rank large-scale e-commerce reviews.\n\nWe have tested and continue to evaluate a range of frontier and open-source models, including Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, Flash LLMs for low-latency tasks, and Meta’s LLaMA-3 family for fine-tuning. Our next phase involves experimenting with specialized Small Language Models (SLMs) trained on a multi-category corpus (~350 million Amazon reviews) to create domain-specific review search and recommendation chatbots.\nAre there any ethical, legal, or societal considerations related to the use of Generative AI or autonomous agents in this context? (e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): company 4 is intentionally designing its generative and agentic AI systems to address key ethical, legal, and societal issues:\n\n- Data Privacy & Consent – All review data is sourced from publicly available or merchant-authorized datasets (e.g., Amazon open data, Shopify merchants via the company 4 Reviews app). We ingest only non-PII text, apply strict access controls, and comply with applicable privacy regulations (e.g., Canadian PIPEDA, GDPR for EU users).\n\n- Fairness & Bias Mitigation – We actively monitor models for category or brand bias by using balanced training corpora and performing regular bias audits on generated recommendations and sentiment summaries.\n\n- Transparency & User Trust – AI-generated summaries and recommendations will be clearly labeled as machine-generated, with explainable reasoning (e.g., surfaced key review signals) to build shopper confidence.\nHow will you measure success for this project? Please include any baseline metrics, KPIs, or qualitative outcomes you hope to observe.: We will measure success through a mix of technical, user, and business outcomes:\n\n- Model Accuracy & Retrieval Quality – Achieve ≥85% F1 score on the held-out golden dataset for sentiment classification and product-category matching. Track mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and precision@k to confirm high-quality cross-brand recommendations.\n\n- Agentic AI Search Performance – Using agentic AI–driven automated search testing, target >90% successful query coverage and maintain real-time retrieval latency <1.5 seconds.\n\n- User Engagement & Trust – Baseline: pilot testers average 1–2 queries/session.

    "qa_consolidated": "Project Summary: Describe the key business problem(s) or opportunity this project addresses. Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: The key business problem this project addresses is the limited scalability of our current teacher-dependent training model, coupled with the shortage of qualified educators in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and the challenges underserved communities face in adopting STEM programs. As a provider of robotics, coding, and space (rocketry) education for K–12 schools, Company 6 relies on resource-intensive teacher preparation: up to 40 hours of in-person training plus annual recertification. This model constrains our ability to expand, as each new school requires significant investment of time and staff, while many regions lack access to trained educators altogether.\n\nAt the same time, the global EdTech market—projected to exceed $400 billion by 2030 is growing rapidly, with STEM education among its fastest-rising segments. Yet, demand for hands-on, future-ready learning far outpaces the number of skilled teachers available, especially in underserved communities where resources and adoption are already limited.\n\nTo address this gap, we propose developing an AI-powered agentic tutoring system that provides students with real-time guidance in troubleshooting and programming. Though models are becoming powerful, a practical path may be to first solve for narrower use cases such as:\n\n1.\tSyntax error correction\n2.\tBasic logic error detection\n3.\tExplaining programming concepts\n4.\tSuggesting code structure improvements\n5.\tAnswering “how do I?” questions from the curriculum\n\nBy shifting support from teachers to intelligent tutoring, we can double our effective student-to-educator ratio (from 4:1 to 8:1), reduce reliance on lengthy teacher training, and expand curriculum access into regions where educator shortages are most acute. This solution empowers students with immediate, personalized assistance, while lowering barriers for underserved schools and enabling sustainable, scalable growth in STEM education delivery.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: The main objective is to reduce our dependency on manual staff support, which is currently a major barrier to scaling our business. By providing an AI-powered agentic tutoring system for student support, we can expand into new schools, tier 2 and tier 3 markets and underserved communities while significantly reducing the effort and time required for each partnership.\n\nIf we do not implement this project, our growth will stall. We won't be able to handle an increased number of schools and students, leading to lost revenue and a decline in our competitive position.\n\n•\tProof of Concept (PoC) & Minimum Viable Product (MVP): We will develop a PoC to validate the core AI functionality and an MVP to demonstrate basic student assistance, with the goal of handling at least 50% of common student queries without requiring human teacher support. This will establish the feasibility and scalability of the solution.\n•\tIntegration with LMS/Portal: We will integrate the solution into the existing Company 6 teacher portal. This integration is crucial for seamless user experience and data collection.\n•\tUser Acceptance Testing (UAT) Environment: This is a critical step to ensure the solution is robust, user-friendly, and ready for a pilot launch with a small group of users.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool. Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: Key Deliverables & Outputs:\n\nThe core deliverable of this project is an Agentic Tutoring System integrated into the Company 6 LMS. This system will combine agentic processes with Company 6’s proprietary curriculum to deliver proactive, personalized support that adapts to each student’s progress in real time.\n\nThe key functionalities and outputs are:\n•\tProactive AI Assistant: Using an agentic architecture, the system will actively monitor lesson progress and content on screen. It will proactively offer context-sensitive tips, hints, and suggestions either on demand or initiated by the system itself, to help students overcome challenges and accelerate learning.\n•\tContext-Aware Response Engine: Built on Company 6’s proprietary curriculum and technical documentation, the AI will provide real-time, contextually accurate answers that are fully aligned with established teaching methodologies. This ensures instructional consistency and reliability.\n•\tReal-Time Code Analysis & Feedback: Leveraging Computer Vision (CV) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), the system can interpret a student’s programming environment from live screens or image captures. It will detect syntax errors, logical gaps, and performance bottlenecks, then provide targeted, actionable feedback to improve student coding outcomes.\n•\tFeedback Loop System: A structured feedback loop will enable continuous system improvements. Insights from student interactions and performance data will be incorporated back into the system, refining the tutoring model over time for greater accuracy and personalization.\n•\tGuardrails for Safe Interaction: A stateful, conversational interface with embedded guardrails will ensure that interactions remain safe, transparent, and educationally appropriate, while also preserving conversation context for a more natural learning experience.\n•\tTeacher Dashboard: A monitoring interface will provide teachers with visibility into student interactions, query resolution patterns, and progress metrics. This allows teachers to intervene when necessary and track how the AI assistant enhances learning outcomes.\n\nContribution of ML/AI Specialists (MLAs):\n\nWe expect the MLAs to be instrumental in the following areas:\n●\tTraining & Grounding the Language Model: The MLAs will be responsible for adapting and optimizing a Large Language Model (LLM) or similar model to align with Company 6’s proprietary curriculum and troubleshooting data. Instead of relying on full-scale fine-tuning, which is costly and requires frequent retraining as the curriculum evolves, we will leverage proven methods such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), instruction fine-tuning, and prompt engineering to ground the model in Company 6’s content. This approach ensures higher accuracy, relevance, and scalability while reducing long-term maintenance overhead.\n●\tDeveloping the Code Analysis Engine: This is a crucial technical component. MLAs will design and implement the computer vision or OCR algorithms to interpret and analyze code from visual inputs. They will also build the logic to identify common programming errors and suggest improvements.\n●\tIntegrating the AI with Existing Infrastructure: The MLAs will work with our development team to build the API for seamless integration of the AI system into the Company 6 portal. This includes setting up the necessary backend systems and pipelines for data flow.\nWho will be the primary users of this solution? Please identify key internal or external user groups (e.g., analysts, customers, clinicians, etc.).: The primary users of this solution are twofold: 1.\tStudents (75% usage volume): The direct end-users who will interact with the AI teaching assistant for real-time support and troubleshooting during their robotics and programming sessions. 2.\tCompany 6' Clients (20% usage volume): This includes our franchisees and partner schools. The solution will serve as a key resource to enhance their educational offerings and streamline their operational support, allowing them to focus on instruction rather than technical support. While not direct users of the chatbot interface itself, our internal Zebra corporate and support teams will be key beneficiaries of the solution's success, as it will reduce the need for manual support and provide valuable data for continuous curriculum improvement.\nHow will this solution integrate with your existing operations or product offerings?: New standalone tool or feature\nPlease describe the dataset(s) you intend to use for this project.: For this project, we'll use a unique, proprietary dataset consisting of our extensive educational materials. This data is crucial for training our conversational AI to provide context-aware and accurate responses based on our curriculum.\n\n1. Course Content & Curriculum Data This dataset contains our full multimedia course materials. Its relevance is paramount, as it will serve as the core knowledge base for the AI, enabling it to answer questions and provide guidance that's consistent with our teaching methodology.\nSource: The data is internally sourced from our Canvas Learning Management System (LMS).\n●\tCollection & Format: It will be exported in a standardized IMS Common Cartridge (IMSCC) format, a type of unstructured data. We will also use video and image files from our courses.\n●\tKey Features: This dataset includes course modules, lesson plans, instructional text, diagrams, and multimedia files.\n●\tApproximate Size: For the initial pilot, we'll use a few select courses, including all their modules.\n\n2. Student Assignment & Code Data This dataset will contain historical student assignments and working code examples. This data is essential for teaching the AI how to analyze and correct common errors.\n●\tSource: This will be internally sourced from student submissions within our learning portals.\n●\tCollection & Format: The data is a combination of unstructured student submissions (text, code files) and structured data related to assignments (e.g., assignment names, dates, student IDs).\n●\tKey Features: It includes student-written code, textual explanations, and, where available, feedback or grades.\n●\tApproximate Size: We can provide a sample of assignments from past student cohorts for the initial training phase.\n\n3. \"Golden Standard\" Code Library This dataset contains high-quality, verified code that successfully achieves specific robot programming objectives. It will serve as a reference for the AI to understand \"correct\" code and provide accurate, effective suggestions.\n\n●\tSource: Internally created and curated by our subject matter experts.\n●\tCollection & Format: This is a structured dataset of code files, potentially with accompanying metadata.\n●\tKey Features: The dataset includes various programming challenges, their corresponding verified solutions, and comments explaining the code logic.\n●\tApproximate Size: A library of working codes for all our core robot missions.\nWhat is the current state of readiness of this dataset?: Raw/unprocessed\nDoes the dataset contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII): False\nPlease describe how PII is handled or anonymized:: \nHow do you plan to evaluate the model or system’s performance?: Our primary evaluation method will be      manual validation, supported by a \"golden dataset\" and ongoing performance metrics.\n\n●\tGolden Dataset: We will use a pre-established benchmark dataset of common student issues and programming challenges. This will allow us to quantitatively measure the bot's accuracy and effectiveness.\n●\tHuman Validation: Our expert curriculum developers and teachers will serve as validators. They will interact with the bot to troubleshoot various coding problems, reviewing its suggestions and providing feedback for continuous improvement. This qualitative feedback is critical for ensuring the bot's recommendations are educationally sound.\n●\tKey Performance Indicators (KPIs): We will monitor performance through a dashboard that tracks metrics such as issue resolution time, response accuracy, and user satisfaction, which will be measured through surveys or feedback forms.\nHave you already explored or are you considering techniques associated with Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for this use case? If so, please specify which specific models or approaches used or are under consideration.: Yes, we have explored techniques associated with Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nWe initially evaluated using Gemini's LLM with a standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. While this approach would be effective for knowledge retrieval from our curriculum documents, it lacks the capability to analyze a student's live coding environment.\n\nTo solve our core use case, which requires real-time troubleshooting based on a student’s work, we are pursuing a multimodal LLM solution. This approach leverages the model’s ability to analyze the screen directly, extract and interpret the code, and then provide contextual, intelligent feedback based on the actual code and its state.\nAre there any ethical, legal, or societal considerations related to the use of Generative AI or autonomous agents in this context? (e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): Transparency: Students should be clearly informed when they are interacting with an AI system to build trust and set appropriate expectations.\n\nPrivacy: Although no personally identifiable information (PII) will be collected, usage data and interaction patterns may still be sensitive and require strong safeguards for protection.\n\nAccessibility: The solution must ensure equitable access, including appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities, so that all learners can benefit.\nHow will you measure success for this project? Please include any baseline metrics, KPIs, or qualitative outcomes you hope to observe.: We'll measure this project's success through a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics.\n\n     Quantitative KPIs\n\n●\tResolution Rate: Our primary metric will be the percentage of student queries the AI teaching assistant can resolve without requiring a teacher or staff member to step in. A successful outcome will be an increase in this rate over time, which directly reflects a decrease in the burden on our support teams. We anticipate improving student query resolution times by 25%, thereby enhancing the overall learning experience and enabling students to complete additional learning challenges more effectively.\n●\tAccuracy of Suggestions: We'll measure the number of correct suggestions provided by the bot as a percentage of requests made, which is your initial metric. We'll track this using a \"golden dataset\" of known problems and solutions, along with human-in-the-loop validation to ensure accuracy.\n●\tUser Engagement: We'll track user adoption and session duration within the bot to ensure it's a valuable and engaging tool for students.\n●\tStudent-to-teacher ratio: We will track changes in the average number of students supported per teacher in classrooms using the AI teaching assistant, comparing against historical baselines. Improvements in this ratio will demonstrate the system’s ability to enhance instructional capacity and free up teacher time for higher-value student interactions.\n\nQualitative Outcomes\n\n●\tImproved Student Confidence: We anticipate a qualitative improvement in student confidence and independence as they receive immediate, effective support. We'll measure this through student and teacher surveys.\n●\tStreamlined Teacher Workflow: Teachers and staff should feel that the AI bot has significantly reduced their workload, allowing them to focus on teaching rather than troubleshooting. We'll confirm this through interviews and feedback sessions with our partners and internal teams.\nWhat infrastructure or platforms do you plan to use to support the development of this project?: Amazon Web Services (AWS)\nIn one or two sentences, describe the ideal MLA candidate for this project.: The ideal candidate for this project would have hands-on experience with multimodal AI systems integrating NLP and computer vision, strong expertise in instruction-tuning LLMs for educational applications, and practical knowledge of real-time inference optimization. They should also have experience with OCR and code analysis, building production-ready APIs, and familiarity with cloud platforms such as AWS SageMaker and Bedrock.\nPlease describe your technical team (if any). Include the number of staff and relevant roles (e.g., ML engineers, data analysts, product managers, etc.).: Our technical, business and management teams are well-equipped to execute this project, with a blend of specialized and full-stack expertise. The team currently includes:\n\n●\tOne Machine Learning Engineer: Focused on the core AI model development, including data processing, model training, and performance tuning.\n●\tOne AI Consultant: Provides strategic guidance and ensures the solution aligns with the latest advancements in AI, offering a high-level perspective on the technical approach.\n●\tTwo Full-Stack Developers: Responsible for building and integrating the solution into our existing platform, managing both the front-end user interface and the back-end infrastructure. ReactsJs and NodeJs with MySQL on AWS is our tech stack.\n●\tOne Product Delivery Lead: Oversees the end-to-end delivery of product, including project management, business analysis, and quality assurance responsibilities.\nIs there any additional context or background information you would like to provide to help us evaluate your use case application?: Company 6 is a rapidly expanding company with a strong presence in the educational technology sector. We currently operate 25 retail locations in Canada and the US, with a growing number in these countries. Our proprietary curricula is a key differentiator, and it's been adopted by over 25 schools across Canada and Jamaica, with further expansion planned into other Caribbean islands.\n\nOur core mission is to equip students with the skills required for the next decade and democratize access to robotics, coding and space (rocketry) education. Partnering with schools is central to this mission. However, our current operational model is not scalable due to the high cost and resource intensity of teacher training and support.\n\nThis project is a strategic initiative to overcome that bottleneck. By leveraging AI, we aim to significantly reduce the cost of our education delivery and support, enabling us to scale our operations rapidly. This will enable us to make our courses more accessible to a broader student base, including Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and underserved communities, where STEM program adoption is growing but limited by the availability of qualified educators and resources. Through this approach, we can advance our goal of democratizing innovation sustainably while unlocking opportunities for students who have historically had limited access to such programs.\nUnnamed: 18: \nUnnamed: 19: \nUnnamed: 20: \nUnnamed: 21: \nUnnamed: 22: \nUnnamed: 23: \nUnnamed: 24: \nUnnamed: 25: \nUnnamed: 26: \nUnnamed: 27: \nUnnamed: 28: \nUnnamed: 29: \nUnnamed: 30: \nUnnamed: 31: \nUnnamed: 32: \nUnnamed: 33: \nUnnamed: 34: \nUnnamed: 35: \nUnnamed: 36: \nUnnamed: 37: \nUnnamed: 38: \nUnnamed: 39: \nUnnamed: 40: \nUnnamed: 41: \nUnnamed: 42: \nUnnamed: 43: "

    "qa_consolidated": "Project Summary: Describe the key business problem(s) or opportunity this project addresses. Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: Company 7.ai is a Canadian healthtech startup building ambient, voice-enabled AI health assistants that relieve documentation, front-office and back-office burdens in outpatient and inpatient care settings. \n\nClinics face unsustainable admin loads: physicians spend large portions of their day on notes while staff are overwhelmed by call triage, email, scheduling, and voicemail backlogs. These are problems most “AI scribe” tools don’t solve because they stop at documentation and don’t close the loop on inbound communications, patient intake, scheduling, or clinical encounter follow up.\n\nWe operate in healthcare IT (clinical workflow automation). The opportunity is to move beyond a single scribe into a voice-driven, multi-agent workflow system that automates call handling, triage, structured clinical intake, and direct EMR entry, with Canadian privacy compliance and bilingual (EN/FR) support. No major competitor currently offers this integrated, Canadian-compliant, connected solution.\n\nOur product implements a modular architecture:\n1. Administrative Agent: access and coverage verification, referrals and prior authorization, triage, scheduling, escalation, waitlist and template optimization, inbound communications management, digital check-in and forms, bilingual EN/FR communications, revenue cycle tasks including clinical documentation improvement and coding, claims scrubbing and submission, capacity and ADT throughput tracking.\n2. Clinical Agent: structured intake, pre-visit summaries, real-time summarization and gap spotting, decision support, medication reconciliation, empathy and communication coaching, orders and task orchestration, rounding and handover, discharge planning and transition, after-visit summaries and patient education, care navigation and social supports, targeted post-encounter follow-up, EMR write-back via SMART on FHIR and HL7. \n3. Regulatory and Safety Agent: compliance and privacy-by-design, consent and preference management, PHI minimization, evaluation and performance monitoring, drift and safety monitoring, A/B testing with guardrails, quality management system activities, and post-market surveillance.\n4. Usability-first dialog flows validated with staff in a real pilot primary care clinic.\n\nTarget Audience\nPrimary users are time-constrained clinicians and clinical administrators seeking efficiency, accuracy, and burnout reduction.\n\nOur first commercialization vertical is Canadian primary care clinics that can implement our solution using an EMR gateway.\n\nGo-to-market focuses on outpatient clinics, clinic chains, group practices, and health authorities in Canada, leveraging provincial pilot programs and a clinic-friendly subscription model. Having successfully been accepted to the Canada Health Infoway and Supply Ontario pre-qualified vendor programs and the BC AI SCRIBE trial, we have a dedicated user base that is excited to have us expand our solutions to bring clinical and administrative agents to practitioners' offices.  \n\nMarket Context\nBased on a blended top-down and bottom-up view, the global market for clinical documentation, intake, and front-office workflow automation is approximately US$10B to US$15B in 2024 with low double-digit growth. Using a conservative serviceable obtainable market at 0.05 percent global penetration, this represents roughly US$13M in ARR potential. In Canada, with about 90,000 physicians and more than 100,000 allied health professionals, the serviceable obtainable market remains approximately US$200M annually at modest adoption.\n\nRegulatory & Interoperability Environment\nThe solution is designed for Canadian and North American health privacy: HIPAA, PHIPA, PIPEDA (with SOC 2 readiness and Canadian data residency) and targets SMART on FHIR/HL7 interoperability. The project goal includes achieving a Health Canada Software as a Medical Device Class I level for the production-ready assistant using multiple sub-agents, a quality management system, verified evaluation frameworks and a post-market surveillance plan.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: The key objectives are as follows: \n1. Automate inbound administrative communications for health facilities, including call triage, escalation, and appointment booking, with a non-integrated fallback mode for message requests.\n2. Standardize clinical intake and pre-visit preparation by generating structured intake and pre-visit summaries that hand-off directly to the Company 7.ai Health Assistant AI scribe.\n3. Deliver a production-ready assistant with interoperability and safety: SMART on FHIR/HL7 connectivity, modular multi-agent architecture with role-based access, and SaMD Class I readiness with privacy-by-design.\n4. Track meaningful KPIs aligned to the business case, including accuracy, latency, voicemail reduction, patient activation, and capacity uplift.\n\nSuccess milestones\n1. Architecture and readiness: \n1.1. Target reference architecture selected with rationale\n1.2. C4 and data-flow diagrams completed\n1.3. RBAC and least-privilege enforced\n1.4. SOC 2-mapped compliance artifacts produced.\n\n2. MVP build and integration\n2.1. Admin Agent callable service live with booking and graceful human handoff\n2.2. Clinical Intake Agent generates pre-visit summaries with valid FHIR bundles.\n2.3. EMR gateway and non-integrated relay operational; end-to-end EMR write-back proven with audit trail.\n2.4. Usability dry-runs completed with ≥90 percent staff task success\n2.5. pilot Go/No-Go passed with no Severity-1 issues and a rollback plan.\n\n3. Discovery and safety groundwork\n3.1. Clinic discovery and value-stream mapping baseline captured in ≥2 clinics; top workflows prioritized.\n3.2. Intent taxonomy v1 covers ≥95 percent of historical intents\n3.3. synthetic testbed covers ≥90 percent of prioritized intents with no PHI.\n\n4. Pilot outcome targets\n4.1. ≥99 percent pre-visit note-completion accuracy; 4.2. ≤60 seconds end-to-end latency from end of patient input to AI scribe output; \n4.3. ≥80 percent patient activation within three months.\n\n5. Program-aligned deliverable\n5.1. A working Proof of Concept plus documentation at program end.\n\nImportance and consequences if delayed or not implemented\n1. Operational strain persists: Without automation, clinics continue to absorb high documentation and front-office loads, exacerbating clinician burnout and limiting access. The project is explicitly designed to reduce this burden and improve care quality.\n2. Lost efficiency and patient experience gains: Latency, voicemail backlog reduction, and patient activation improvements will not be realized, undermining the ROI case captured in the pilot metrics plan.\n3. Interoperability and compliance gaps remain: Without the planned SMART on FHIR/HL7 adapters, RBAC, and privacy-by-design artifacts, safe at-scale deployment is delayed and integration opportunities with EMRs and pilot sites stall.\n4. Commercial momentum slows: Delays risk deferring a production-ready assistant and reference architecture that are central to partnerships and near-term pilots.\n\nIn sum, the project’s objectives and milestones directly target automation of high-cost manual workflows, delivery of a production-ready, interoperable assistant, and rigorous KPI validation. Delays would prolong administrative bottlenecks, defer measurable capacity gains, and slow a safe, compliant path to deployment.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool. Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: The 6 high-level outputs and deliverables include:\n1. Functional prototype\n1.1. Voice-enabled Administrative Agent that performs call triage, escalation, booking, and a non-integrated fallback that generates actionable message requests with an audit trail.\n\n1.2. Clinical Intake and Pre-visit Summarizer that produces structured intake and pre-visit summaries, output as valid FHIR bundles ready for clinician review and AI Scribe write-back.\n\n1.3.

Final presentation and deployment plan consistent with cohort outcomes for POC development and knowledge transfer.\n\nWhat we hope Vector MLAs may help deliver within the cohort:\n1. Two FTE MLAs for 16 weeks working with our team to build, integrate, evaluate, and document the above deliverables.\n2. Work (remotely) primarily in our secure environment with company-provided compute and data, with access to Vector resources as needed.\n3. Active development of the PoC under Vector’s technical supervision, including coding, prototyping, and testing.\n\nBy the end of the cohort we aim to have a working, instrumented PoC that books appointments, handles intake, escalates, writes back to the AI Scribe through a standards-based adapter, and includes the APIs, dashboards, evaluation harness, and compliance artifacts required to proceed to an expanded pilot. \n\nOf note, we have already identified a pilot clinic and secured funding for this phase of the project.\nWho will be the primary users of this solution? Please identify key internal or external user groups (e.g., analysts, customers, clinicians, etc.).: Primary customers are chains of clinics, with individual clinics as additional early sites. Health authorities will also become customers as we progress. Primary end users include clinicians (physicians, NPs, PAs, nurses, allied health), clinical administrators, practice managers, IT administrators, and compliance and privacy officers; secondary users include patients and caregivers and operations analysts. We already have users in Canada and the United States who are excited to trial the solution. Initial pilots will run with clinic chains and individual clinics due to faster procurement and lower regulatory complexity, while we have established pathways in several provinces to pilot within more regulated health authority facilities. We have also begun an exchange with Health Canada regarding Software as a Medical Device classification to support safe pilots and subsequent scale-up.\nHow will this solution integrate with your existing operations or product offerings?: Enhancement to an existing system\nPlease describe the dataset(s) you intend to use for this project.: The datasets that we will use include, but are not limited to, the following: \n1. Real-world clinical call corpus\n1.1. Approximately 1,000 hours of anonymized, exported call audio from a Canadian primary care clinic as the seed dataset for intent taxonomy, routing, latency, and human-in-the-loop QA.\n1.2. A synthetic medical records dataset of 1,000 patients with multiple encounters per record for the most common primary care consultation reasons.\n1.3. Governance includes PHI-free verification, storage in a secure environment, and documented sampling for train, validation, and blind test splits.\n\n2. Synthetic and programmatic augmentation\n2.1. Generation of multi-turn EN/FR call simulations covering rare edge cases, escalation paths, and accessibility variants, with prompt templates and noise profiles aligned to clinic telephony.\n2.2. Synthetic transcripts paired with TTS-based audio for controlled ablations and error injection to test robustness and redaction policies.\n\n3. Open ASR and diarization benchmarks for robustness\n3.1. Mozilla Common Voice for multilingual and accent diversity.\n3.2.

ElevenLabs Grants program acceptance provides year-long credits and tooling that can be integrated into evaluation pipelines for multilingual, expressive voice experiments. \n7.2. Ongoing dialogue with Providence Health Care Ventures in British Columbia to support pathway-to-pilot evaluation within more regulated facilities.\nWhat is the current state of readiness of this dataset?: Annotation pipeline is in place\nDoes the dataset contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII): False\nPlease describe how PII is handled or anonymized:: \nHow do you plan to evaluate the model or system’s performance?: 1. Golden datasets and benchmark suites\n1.1. “Gold Set v1” for access and scheduling built from 1,000 hours of anonymized Canadian primary-care call audio, plus synthetic EN/FR augmentations. Stratified by intent, language, and acoustics; split into train/dev/blind-test with leakage checks.\n1.2. Task-oriented dialogue benchmarks to stress-test booking and escalation policies before pilot, using Schema-Guided Dialogue and Taskmaster-1, mapped to your intent/slot schema.\n1.3.

Clinician review breakpoints for pre-visit summaries and booking confirmations, with structured rubrics on correctness, completeness, and clinical relevance.\n2.2. Front-office staff QA on triage and escalation outcomes, with disagreement adjudication and calibration sessions.\n2.3 Shadow-mode trials in a partnered clinic in British Columbia, then staged rollout with safe fallbacks and human override.\n\n3. Heuristics and business rules\n3.1 Guardrails for consent capture, identity checks, clinic-specific scheduling constraints, and escalation to human when confidence is low or P95 latency is exceeded.\n3.2 Policy engine with versioned rules for hours, providers, templates, and referral requirements with rule coverage reported alongside performance metrics.\n3.3 Safety filters for PHI minimization, profanity/abuse escalation, and hard blocks for restricted actions.\n\n4. Pre/post comparisons and A/B testing\n4.1 Operational baselines collected 2–4 weeks pre-pilot: voicemail backlog, abandonment rate, average handle time, booking lead time, schedule utilization, and no-show rate.\n4.2 Difference-in-differences analysis across pilot vs. control sites; A/B or phased rollouts where feasible.\n\nProgram targets (initial): pre-visit note completion ≥ 99 percent accuracy; end-to-end latency from patient input to scribe output ≤ 60 seconds; ≥ 80 percent patient activation within 3 months; material reduction in voicemail backlog and abandonment.\n\n5. Metrics and dashboards\n5.1 Speech/turn-taking: Automatic speech recognition word error rate, diarization, speaker-turn accuracy.\n5.2 Dialogue quality: intent, slot exact-match, escalation precision/recall, booking success rate, fallback rate, safe-completion rate.\n5.3 Summarization: factuality and consistency scores with human rubric audits.\n5.4 Safety and privacy: PHI leakage rate, hallucination rate, harmful-content flagging precision/recall.\n5.5 Fairness/robustness: performance parity across EN/FR, accent clusters, and call types, with gaps ≤ 5 percentage points where feasible.\n5.6 Real-time dashboards for ops and executive rollups for return on investment (capacity uplift, time saved, access metrics).\n\n6. Evaluation pipelines and documentation\n6.1 Reproducible pipelines for data curation, labeling, model training, and report generation, with versioning, seed control, and immutable artifacts.\n6.2 C4 and data-flow diagrams that link evaluation touchpoints to trust zones and a threat model updated as models change.\n6.3 Post-market surveillance plan for continuous monitoring, issue taxonomy, and rollback criteria aligned to SaMD Class I readiness.\n\n7. Resources and partnerships that strengthen evaluation\n7.1 Pilot clinic in Canada already engaged to trial the system and provide human-in-the-loop feedback.\n7.2 ElevenLabs Grants program resources for robust text-to-speech and speech-to-speech synthetic augmentation in EN/FR and diverse voices with 33 million credits secured.\n7.3 Ongoing dialogue with Providence Health Care Ventures (BC) to support pathway-to-pilot evaluation in more regulated facilities.\nHave you already explored or are you considering techniques associated with Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for this use case? If so, please specify which specific models or approaches used or are under consideration.: Yes. Our stack is GenAI-native and we’re already using and evaluating LLM techniques across the speech, orchestration, and safety layers:\n1. Azure AI Foundry for orchestration, summarization, and tool-calling to scheduler/EMR: GPT-4o family and o-series models via Azure AI Foundry with content filtering and model routing. We also use the Azure Speech Studio and its developing features to be paired with Azure Communications Services. \n\n2. Medical ASR: We have explored and have the option to install a self-hosted trial of Deepgram Nova-3 Medical for high-accuracy, low-latency transcription in clinical settings; also evaluating Azure Speech as a fallback. \n\n3. Domain LLMs (medical): We are experimenting with Google’s MedGemma (open models for medical text/image comprehension; 4B multimodal and 27B text-only) and tracking Med-Gemini research; used for clinical text understanding and guideline-aware checks.\n\n4. Open/self-hosted instruct models from Hugging Face (e.g., Gemma/Gemma-based, Llama, Mistral variants) for intent/slot extraction, redaction assistance, and cost-efficient on-prem inference when PHI exposure must be minimized.\n\n5. Voice synthesis / speech-to-speech: ElevenLabs (via our grants program) for multilingual EN/FR voices and accent coverage in synthetic data generation and usability testing. \n\nOur approach patterns for the development of the above into the outputs and deliverables previously described, include: \n1. Retrieval-augmented generation over policy/clinic playbooks.\n2. Structured function/tool-calling for system of record (our AI Scribe / an EMR) write-back and eligibility checks. \n3. State-machine action graph to keep agents deterministic for safety\n4. Evaluation with golden sets and human-in-the-loop review.\nAre there any ethical, legal, or societal considerations related to the use of Generative AI or autonomous agents in this context? (e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): Our first duty is patient safety and clinician enablement. Agentic systems that schedule care, triage symptoms, or summarize encounters can create real harm if they misroute urgent cases, fabricate facts, or erode clinician vigilance. We mitigate this with human-in-the-loop gates at high-impact moments, deterministic action graphs rather than free-form autonomy, confidence thresholds that trigger escalation to staff, and continuous post-deployment monitoring tied to a documented risk register.\n\nFairness and bias: Speech and language performance can vary by accent, language, and noise conditions. We design datasets and evaluations to measure parity across EN and FR, accent clusters such as en-CA and fr-CA, and acoustic settings such as handset versus speakerphone, then set parity targets and corrective retraining where gaps exceed thresholds. We also monitor intent and slot accuracy across demographic proxies gathered ethically, and we publish evaluation summaries to build user trust.\n\nPrivacy, data minimization, and consent: We collect only what is necessary for the task, keep PHI out of analytics through de-identification, and enforce role-based access with audit trails. For Canada, we align consent practices with PHIPA’s requirements for knowledgeable consent and the “circle of care,” and with PIPEDA’s principles for meaningful consent and limiting collection. We disclose recording at call start, provide opt-outs, and maintain retention and deletion schedules.\n\nRegulatory pathway and correctness of claims: We are preparing for Health Canada oversight as Software as a Medical Device. Our initial scope targets Class I readiness, with quality management, post-market surveillance, and documented human oversight. As functionality expands, we will reassess classification using Health Canada’s SaMD guidance and examples, and we will adjust processes if risk class increases. We are using some of the more involved NHS and FDA guidance where Health Canada guidance is lacking. \n\nTransparency, accountability, and auditability: We maintain dataset cards, model cards, decision logs, and immutable audit trails mapped to SOC 2 logging controls via our Vanta GRC platform so that actions are explainable to clinicians, privacy officers, and regulators. We align our risk program to NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework and its Generative AI profile, and we operate with explicit service level objectives for accuracy and latency.\n\nSecurity and misuse: We protect recordings, transcripts, and model prompts with encryption in transit and at rest, enforce least privilege, and monitor for prompt injection, data exfiltration, and harmful content. We include red-teaming for jailbreaks and abuse, and we maintain incident response procedures consistent with SOC 2 expectations for logging, detection, and reporting.\nScope of practice and user trust. The assistant never makes diagnoses or overrides clinician judgment. Outputs are marked as drafts for review, with visible confidence signals, model provenance, and links to underlying evidence where applicable. We provide clear user education, disclosures about synthetic voices, and guardrails to prevent voice impersonation.\n\nSocietal impact and workforce effects: We design the system to reduce clerical burden rather than displace clinical roles. We publish change-management materials, measure staff experience, and include a structured channel for feedback and refusal. We build bilingual access that supports equity for English and French speakers and we design for accessibility.\n\nExternal guardrails and safety research: We plan to initiate a dialogue with LawZero, the new nonprofit launched by , to explore integrating a “safe-by-design” guardrail framework inspired by their Scientist AI approach and benchmarks for trustworthy agents. The goal is to increase transparency about agent goals, to detect deceptive or harmful behaviors, and to block unsafe actions before they reach production systems.\n\nGovernance and continuous improvement: We run formal Transparency, Equity, Value, and Voice practices that include golden datasets, blind tests, and pre/post comparisons at pilot sites, and we publish an evaluation plan that names owners, thresholds, and rollback criteria. We review drift, error taxonomies, and bias metrics on a regular cadence, and we plan to re-certify releases against Health Canada SaMD guidance when functional scope changes.\nHow will you measure success for this project? Please include any baseline metrics, KPIs, or qualitative outcomes you hope to observe.: We will measure success with a pre-defined baseline (2–4 weeks before pilot), followed by continuous dashboards and a formal end-of-pilot read-out. Baselines will be captured from call logs, scheduling systems, and AI Scribe or EMR audit trails, then compared to pilot-period metrics using A/B or difference-in-differences where feasible.\n\nOperational access and admin efficiency: We aim to reduce voicemail backlog and call abandonment relative to baseline and to shorten average handle time and time-to-booking. We expect higher first-contact resolution and improved schedule utilization. Success will be evidenced by a material decline in backlog and abandonment, meaningful reductions in handle time, and measurable lifts in utilization and same-day/next-day access.\n\nClinical intake and documentation quality: We will track accuracy and completeness of pre-visit summaries and structured intake against a clinician rubric, with a target of ≥99 percent pre-visit note-completion accuracy. We will also measure time-to-close the chart from EMR logs and aim for a clear reduction versus baseline.\n\nPatient engagement: We will measure patient engagement (e.g., completion of digital check-in, confirmations, and follow-ups) with a target of ≥80 percent within three months at pilot sites, alongside concise micro-surveys after calls.\n\nSafety, privacy, and compliance: We will track PHI leakage rate (target zero in redacted analytics), safe-completion rate for guarded flows, and incident counts/severity; we will require zero critical safety incidents and maintain documented human-in-the-loop approvals at designated checkpoints.\nFairness and robustness. We will monitor parity across English/French and accent clusters (e.g., en-CA, fr-CA) for key metrics such as intent F1, slot exact-match, and escalation precision/recall, aiming for performance gaps ≤5 percentage points; we will also track robustness across acoustic/noise profiles.\nInteroperability and workflow completion. We will validate that FHIR Bundles pass conformance checks (target 100 percent valid in production paths) and that bookings, tasks, and write-backs complete successfully end-to-end with auditable IDs.\n\nHuman factors and adoption: We will collect clinician and staff usability scores and short burnout/effort proxies, plus narrative feedback from debriefs. Success looks like high usability, clear perceived time savings, and growing voluntary use without mandate.\n\nProgram-level KPIs and Go/No-Go criteria: At minimum, we expect: ≥99 percent pre-visit note accuracy; ≤60 seconds P95 latency; ≥80 percent patient activation; a material decline in voicemail backlog and abandonment; demonstrable reductions in time-to-booking and time-to-close the chart; zero critical safety incidents; and ≥95 percent interoperability validations passed. Meeting or exceeding these thresholds, with neutral-to-positive fairness checks and positive staff/patient feedback, will constitute a Go for expanded pilots.\nWhat infrastructure or platforms do you plan to use to support the development of this project?: Microsoft Azure, Open-source or public tools (e.g., Colab, Hugging Face, Weights & Biases), ElevenLabs, Deepgram, n8n / Langchain\nIn one or two sentences, describe the ideal MLA candidate for this project.: The ideal candidate for this project would be a hands-on ML engineer with experience shipping LLM- and agent-powered workflows (prompt engineering, tool-calling/RAG), strong NLP and data cleaning skills, and familiarity with speech pipelines (ASR/diarization), Azure AI Foundry, and open models (Hugging Face). They should be comfortable building evaluation pipelines and dashboards, working with healthcare standards (SMART on FHIR/HL7), and applying privacy-by-design practices for PHI. It would be a bonus if they have English and French capability and, especially, prior work in clinical settings.\nPlease describe your technical team (if any). Include the number of staff and relevant roles (e.g., ML engineers, data analysts, product managers, etc.).: We have a 7-person core team: two QA specialists focused on test automation, safety checks, and regulatory validation (one who is solely focused on clinical QA); a clinical lead / Chief Medical Officer who define requirements, evaluation rubrics, and human-in-the-loop review; one ML engineer responsible for LLM/ASR pipelines, RAG, and metrics; one clinical interoperability engineer owning SMART on FHIR/HL7 adapters, EMR integrations, and data security; and one product manager coordinating roadmap, pilots, and stakeholder feedback.

    "qa_consolidated": "Project Summary: Describe the key business problem(s) or opportunity this project addresses. Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: Company 8 proposes an AI-powered multi-agent scheduling assistant to streamline hospital staff scheduling by replacing the current manual Excel and email workflows. The system uses generative AI in a conversational interface to gather clinician preferences, availability, and constraints in natural language. Instead of schedulers sending spreadsheets or numerous emails, the AI assistant engages with clinicians in a dialogue to collect their scheduling needs, clarifying ambiguities and ensuring all inputs are understood. The assistant then validates these requests against scheduling rules (e.g. shift limits, skill mix requirements) and flags or helps resolve any conflicts or overlaps. All collected data feeds directly into Company 8’s existing scheduling platform. This solution will reduce administrative burden on department schedulers, shorten the schedule creation cycle, and improve accuracy and staff satisfaction by collaboratively resolving scheduling issues in real-time.\n\n\nOur proposed solution is an Agentic Generative AI system that serves as a conversational scheduling coordinator. It interacts with multiple stakeholders through natural language, effectively becoming a scheduling “co-pilot” for the department:\n\nInteractive Data Intake and smart import tool: The AI agent initiates or responds to clinicians via a chat-based interface (which could be a web portal or messaging platform). It asks for their availability, preferred shifts, vacation requests, and other constraints in a friendly, structured dialogue. For example, a clinician can simply say, “I prefer morning shifts next week and need Friday off,” and the assistant will interpret and record this input. It asks follow-up questions if details are missing or unclear (e.g., “Do you have any preference between Monday and Tuesday for your morning shifts?”), mimicking how a human scheduler would clarify ambiguous requests.  In parallel, the Smart Import Tool enables schedulers to upload Excel or CSV files containing availability, constraints, and preferences directly into Company 8 Scheduling. Using a mapping UI, planners can align column headers (e.g., physician name, date, shift type, constraint type) with Company 8’s data schema. The tool performs basic validation and error checking, flags inconsistencies before import, and provides a preview mode so users can confirm accuracy. Historical import templates can be stored for recurring use, accelerating the process for each new scheduling period.\n\nTogether, these two intake modes — conversational AI and structured file import — give organizations flexibility to work within their current habits while transitioning toward full platform adoption. Data gathered through chat or import is tagged, logged, and made traceable in Company 8, creating a single source of truth for constraints and preferences. This dual approach not only reduces manual data entry and errors but also bridges the gap between offline workflows (Excel, email, paper) and the digital scheduling environment.\n\nConstraint Validation: As inputs are gathered, the system automatically checks them against institutional rules and individual contract constraints. It knows, for instance, how many hours per week a clinician can work, mandatory rest periods, or specific skill requirements per shift. If a clinician’s request violates a rule (for example, too many consecutive night shifts), the assistant immediately notifies them and suggests alternatives (e.g., “You have requested four night shifts in a row, which exceeds policy. Would you like to reduce this to 2 or 3 nights?”). This real-time validation ensures that most issues are resolved upfront, rather than discovered later by the scheduler.\n\nConflict Resolution: One of the most challenging aspects of scheduling is handling conflicts (such as two clinicians requesting the same limited slot or too few people available for a critical shift). The AI assistant will detect these conflicts as the data comes in. It can proactively address them by alerting the affected users or negotiating solutions. For example, if two surgeons both request the same week off, the assistant can inform them of the overlap and gather additional input: perhaps one is willing to swap vacation weeks after a conversation mediated by the AI. In cases where an immediate resolution isn’t possible, the system flags the conflict clearly for the human scheduler and even provides context or suggestions (like a ranked list of possible resolutions based on past resolution patterns or fairness criteria). The goal is to handle simpler conflicts autonomously and assist the scheduler in making final decisions on tougher conflicts.\n\nAutomated Schedule Assembly: Once inputs are collected and refined, the system compiles them into a structured format compatible with Company 8’s scheduling engine. Essentially, the AI translates the conversational inputs into scheduling data (shift preferences, availability calendars, etc.). The Company 8 scheduling system can then automatically generate draft schedules using this data, or the scheduler can use the compiled inputs to manually finalize a schedule with confidence that all preferences and constraints are up to date.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: Our project has clear objectives to drive efficiency and align with Company 8’s strategic goals of operational excellence and user-centric innovation:\n\nAutomate Manual Workflows: Eliminate the need for manual spreadsheets and email threads by providing a one-stop conversational interface for scheduling data collection. This directly reduces administrative overhead for schedulers.\n\nImprove Accuracy and Compliance: Ensure scheduling constraints (working hour limits, coverage requirements, union rules, etc.) are adhered to automatically through built-in validations. This reduces human error and compliance issues, aligning with our mission to relieve administrative burden while maintaining fairness and safety.\n\nAccelerate Schedule Finalization: Shorten the end-to-end scheduling cycle. By gathering complete and correct information in a single interactive session (rather than over days of email exchanges), initial schedules can be generated faster. This means departments can release final schedules earlier, improving operational predictability.\n\nEnhance Stakeholder Satisfaction: Engage clinicians in a collaborative manner, giving them confidence that their preferences are heard and respected. A more transparent, interactive process leads to higher clinician satisfaction and engagement. At the same time, schedulers benefit from a co-pilot that reduces their workload and stress, improving job satisfaction.\n\nAlign with Intelligent Workflow Strategy: This project advances Company 8’s strategic goal of intelligent care coordination. By embedding a generative AI assistant into the scheduling workflow, we demonstrate Company 8’s commitment to innovative solutions that streamline healthcare operations. The solution not only modernizes a tedious process but also showcases AI-driven transformation in day-to-day clinical operations, reinforcing Company 8’s reputation as a leader in healthcare innovation.\n\nIn summary, the Conversational Scheduling Assistant will modernize the scheduling process by leveraging advanced AI to interact, understand, and help coordinate schedules as a human would – but faster and with fewer errors. This aligns directly with Company 8’s broader mission to provide intelligent solutions that increase efficiency, reduce burnout, and empower healthcare teams with better tools. It addresses a real pain point in primary and acute care settings, and its successful implementation would be a tangible step toward smarter, more adaptive healthcare operations.\n\nMilestones:\n\nConversational intake MVP;\n\nRules/constraint validator;\n\nConflict-resolution agent;\n\nAPI integration to Company 8 Scheduling;\n\nPilot metrics showing reduced cycle time and fewer post-publish trades.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool. Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: Working PoC: multi-agent conversational assistant (web chat) that collects availability/preferences/constraints.\n\nValidation & conflict modules: programmatic rules checks (hours, rest, skills mix) and agent-assisted conflict handling.\n\nIntegration layer (APIs) to push structured intake to Company 8 Scheduling and pull rules/rosters/templates.\n\nConfig & admin dashboard (lightweight) for schedulers: status of submissions, flagged conflicts, suggested resolutions.\n\nDocs & deployment plan: architecture, ops runbooks, Responsible AI notes, production pathway on Azure.\nWho will be the primary users of this solution? Please identify key internal or external user groups (e.g., analysts, customers, clinicians, etc.).: The primary users of the proposed solution are hospital department schedulers and the clinicians they schedule.  Department Schedulers (Administrators): These are the staff responsible for creating and managing schedules (for example, a scheduling coordinator in an ER department). For them, the AI assistant will serve as a powerful co-worker. It handles the tedious parts of collecting inputs and ensures rules are followed, allowing the human scheduler to focus on higher-level decisions and final approval. Schedulers will interact with the system through an administrative interface where they can oversee the conversation progress (e.g., see which clinicians have submitted info, view conflict alerts generated by the AI, and intervene or adjust as needed). This helps schedulers work more efficiently and confidently, reducing burnout from the formerly repetitive communication tasks.  Clinicians (Doctors, Nurses, and Other Healthcare Providers): These are the individuals whose availability and preferences are being scheduled. Instead of filling out Excel templates or emailing requests, clinicians will interact with the conversational AI (via chat or a guided form that feels like chat). This offers them a convenient, user-friendly experience – they can quickly provide their availability in plain language at any time, on any device. The AI ensures they are immediately notified of any issues with their requests (like overlapping commitments or rule violations) and can adjust in the moment. This interactive process gives clinicians more transparency (they know their requests are received and valid) and potentially more input into resolving scheduling conflicts fairly. Engaging clinicians in this manner is likely to improve their satisfaction with the scheduling process, as it fosters a sense of collaboration and fairness (everyone is talking to the same unbiased assistant).\nHow will this solution integrate with your existing operations or product offerings?: Enhancement to an existing system\nPlease describe the dataset(s) you intend to use for this project.: What it contains & relevance: Past shift assignments, roles, locations, dates/times; recorded constraints/preferences; common exceptions/changes; scheduler notes (where available). Used to model typical patterns, validate rules, and design conflict strategies.\n\nSources: Company 8’s scheduling.\n\n\nApprox. size/time range: Multi-year history across several departments; tens to hundreds of thousands of shift rows (varies by site), plus smaller tables for constraints/preferences. Exact volumes available at kickoff.\nWhat is the current state of readiness of this dataset?: Raw/unprocessed\nDoes the dataset contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII): False\nPlease describe how PII is handled or anonymized:: \nHow do you plan to evaluate the model or system’s performance?: Human-in-the-loop: Scheduler reviews suggestions/resolutions before finalize/publish.\n\nImplement openevals testing including \n\nEvaluators LLM-as-Judge Extraction and tool calls \n\nEvaluating structured output with exact match \n\nEvaluating structured output with LLM-as-a-Judge \n\nRAG Correctness Helpfulness Groundedness \n\nRetrieval relevance \n\nRetrieval relevance with LLM as judge \n\nRetrieval relevance with string evaluators\n\nPre/Post metrics & dashboards:\n\nReduction in Scheduling Cycle Time: A primary goal is to reduce how long it takes to go from initiating schedule collection to finalizing the schedule. We will measure the total turnaround time for schedule creation before and after implementing the AI assistant. Our target might be, for example, a reduction by 30-50% in the scheduling cycle. Faster schedule completion not only saves administrator time but also gives clinicians their rosters sooner.\n\nDecrease in Communication Rounds: We expect far fewer back-and-forth emails or revisions. As a proxy, we can count the average number of touchpoints or revisions needed per scheduling period. Success would mean that many schedules are completed in one cycle of AI-facilitated input, rather than multiple correction cycles. A concrete metric could be “number of corrections or re-run schedules needed” – with the AI assistant, this should drop significantly (ideally to near zero for routine periods).\n\nScheduler Time Spent: We will track how many hours the scheduling staff spend on schedule coordination. If the AI assistant is effective, the human scheduler’s active involvement time (excluding waiting for inputs) should decrease. For instance, if a scheduler currently spends 10 hours per week on communications and data entry, we aim to cut that by at least half. This time savings can be quantified through time logs or self-reported estimates and is directly tied to cost and efficiency improvements.\n\nAdherence to Constraints: Measure the incidence of scheduling rule violations or overlooked preferences in the final schedule. We anticipate that with automated validation, compliance with all constraints (legal, contractual, personal preferences) will be near 100%. Any violations or mismatches found after schedule publication (e.g., someone scheduled on a day they asked off) would indicate a failure. The goal is to eliminate such errors entirely.\n\nUser satisfaction (clinician & scheduler CSAT/NPS, qualitative feedback).\nHave you already explored or are you considering techniques associated with Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for this use case? If so, please specify which specific models or approaches used or are under consideration.: At Company 8 we started exploring different use cases around Gen AI and LLMs, we are building a platform where we can create reusable components and enable fast productization, including: \n\nLLM-driven conversational intake (prompt-engineered; few-shot with scheduling exemplars).\n\nAgentic multi-agent orchestration (e.g., one agent for dialogue, one for validation/tools, one for conflict suggestions).\nAre there any ethical, legal, or societal considerations related to the use of Generative AI or autonomous agents in this context? (e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): Privacy & residency: Canadian data residency; no PHI; de-identified staff data for modeling.\n\nRacial and violence filters\nHow will you measure success for this project? Please include any baseline metrics, KPIs, or qualitative outcomes you hope to observe.: Operational: post-publish trades/corrections, scheduler hours on intake.\n\nExperience: Clinician & scheduler CSAT/NPS.\n\nAdoption: % departments using assistant after pilot; time to first schedule draft.\nWhat infrastructure or platforms do you plan to use to support the development of this project?: Microsoft Azure, Models :  Azure open AI hosted in canada with gpt 4.1  Azure Open AI embedding Large as embbeding  Data :  Snowflake  Graphql  Pgvector  GeAI Frameworks:  langchain  langgraph  Monitoring :  langsmith  Server :  Langgraph  Kubernetes  Scheduling API  UI / interaction :  Typescript  ReactJs\nIn one or two sentences, describe the ideal MLA candidate for this project.: The ideal candidate for this project would be an AI engineer with strong software engineering fundamentals (Python) and hands-on experience building LLM applications: prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and tool integration via MCP servers.\nPlease describe your technical team (if any).

Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: Key Business Problem\n\nFundamental physics has slowed in making breakthrough discoveries. While more physicists than ever are working, progress is limited because today’s questions are far harder and less intuitive. Human reasoning struggles with ideas like quantum fields or ten-dimensional space. Academic systems were built for an earlier era and depend on individual brilliance instead of scalable methods. Meanwhile, AI and distributed computing are advancing quickly, but these tools have not yet been applied in a systematic way to fundamental science. The result is a growing gap: the biggest scientific questions are stalling just as technology capable of helping is taking off.\n\nOpportunity\n\nThis is the moment to create a new kind of research organization. AI is now able to reason, not just recognize patterns. Applied to fundamental science, it can explore theories beyond human cognitive limits. Company 9 aims to combine deep scientific expertise with advanced AI engineering and a mission-aligned non-profit model, operating globally and free from the constraints of traditional institutions. The market for AI-driven scientific discovery is wide open - there is no established player with this mix of capabilities.\n\nIndustry & Target Audience\n\nCompany 9 works at the intersection of advanced AI and fundamental science. Its audience includes academic researchers, scientific institutions, philanthropic funders, and global science policy makers who share the goal of accelerating discovery. Interest in AI for science is growing across both private and public sectors, and regulatory frameworks are still forming, leaving room for early movers to shape the field.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: Key Objectives\n\nCreate AI systems for scientific reasoning: Build technology that can generate hypotheses, perform multi-step symbolic reasoning, and evaluate scientific models beyond what human intuition can handle.\n\nAccelerate fundamental physics research: Remove the bottleneck caused by limited human cognitive bandwidth and outdated academic processes.\n\nEstablish a new research model: Operate as a global, independent non-profit that merges the speed and engineering focus of a tech company with the depth of a research lab.\n\nOpen and scale knowledge creation: Design systems that capture, refine, and share evolving insights to make basic science faster and more collaborative.\n\nSuccess Milestones\n\nEarly platform releases: Deliver the first working versions of the AI research system (starting with physics) and demonstrate its ability to generate and test novel scientific ideas.\n\nGrowing research impact: Produce results recognized by the scientific community—new models, insights, or validated hypotheses that would have been difficult for humans alone.\n\nCommunity adoption: Build partnerships with universities, research institutes, and funding bodies who use and contribute to the platform.\n\nGlobal network of contributors: Attract and maintain a diverse team of engineers, scientists, and collaborators who expand the system’s capabilities over time.\n\nImportance of Timely Execution\n\nIf this project is delayed or not implemented, the slowdown in fundamental physics discovery will continue. Human-only research will remain constrained by cognitive limits and outdated academic structures, and the accelerating power of modern AI will be left untapped. This risks missing a once-in-a-generation opportunity: AI is just now reaching the level where it can reason and build theories. Waiting means losing momentum, letting others define the standards for AI-driven science, and postponing potential breakthroughs that could reshape our understanding of the universe and drive long-term technological and societal progress.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool. Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: Company 9 is interested in the MLA program to work on internal tools to contribute towards the development of the AI Physicist:\n\nCore Reasoning Engine - A central model that coordinates scientific reasoning and integrates outputs from specialized modules such as symbolic regression, question formulation, and model evaluation. This is the foundation for scalable theory-building \n\nSpecialized Modular Components - Independent but interconnected models that handle tasks like hypothesis generation, multi-step symbolic reasoning, and formal model building. These modules must exchange information dynamically and adapt through reinforcement learning.\n\nKnowledge Capture Layer - An internal repository to record evolving insights, enabling reuse and refinement of ideas over time. This ensures the organization can build on previous work without repeating experiments.\n\nAutomation Pipelines - Infrastructure to run simulations and testing workflows automatically, feeding results back into the reasoning engine for continuous improvement \n\nThese deliverables are critical for enabling scalable, AI-driven scientific discovery and will directly determine the success of the cohort’s work.\nWho will be the primary users of this solution?

These include published physics papers, experimental data, mathematical formulations, and structured metadata (citations, references, equations). This material is essential for training and evaluating AI systems that can reason about physical theories and generate new hypotheses.\n\n2. Sources\n\nThe data will come from a mix of public scientific repositories (such as arXiv and other open-access physics archives), partner institutions that provide curated datasets, and internally generated research notes and outputs from the Company 9 team and collaborators.\n\n3. Collection Method and Format\n\nThese data are gathered through publicly available APIs and bulk-download services from open-science archives, plus direct contributions from research partners. The current formats are mixed:\n\nStructured: bibliographic metadata (titles, authors, references, citation graphs).\n\nSemi-structured: LaTeX/Markdown representations of equations and models.\n\nUnstructured: full-text scientific papers, diagrams, and research notes.\n\n4.

Doing it manually does not allow us to scale. \nDeveloping a proprietary data set (vectorization and bucketization of proprietary data in order to feed and train a new model, to execute our vision of \"Intentional Serendipity”\nDevelop and train a propriety model of “intentional Serendipity”\n\nIf this project is delayed - we won’t be able to scale beyond our own events, not to bigger international conferences due to the limiting nature of extensive manual work.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool. Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: At best: A functional & operational prototype, with a dashboard and supporting Bakend system \nAt minimum: propriety dataset  - vectorization and bucketization of proprietary data and an AI workflow pipeline - ready to train\nWho will be the primary users of this solution?

If so, please specify which specific models or approaches used or are under consideration.: We are currently in the initial phase of exploration and consideration, and still need support to finalize the workflow. We plan to create a high-quality dataset of what makes a great match, using Vertex AI Data labeling and AI pipelines, and add logged user feedback (such as \"good match,\" \"bad match\") into BigQuery. Once we have thousands of labeled examples in BigQuery, train the model on the specific nuances of our matching and relationship building logic. We use LLM and generative AI for curated conversation starters between recommended matches, for follow ups and relationship building pipelines.\nAre there any ethical, legal, or societal considerations related to the use of Generative AI or autonomous agents in this context? (e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): We develop the model based on our own biases of what is considered as a good/bad match and need to keep in mind to make it unbiased as possible, using the implementation of user feedback loops as well as to develop various indications to alert and expose alarming patterns. When matching people, we need to take in consideration gender, sexual, cultural and geographical consideration and socially accepted behaviours, as well as implementing barriers to misuse or alarming behaviours to keep the safety of users. To increase user trust we need to be as transparent as possible and share reasonings for recommended actions. We need to implement feedback loops in order to identify issues in real time. And we need to verify the implementation of privacy and safety of data.\nHow will you measure success for this project? Please include any baseline metrics, KPIs, or qualitative outcomes you hope to observe.: Qualitative outcome:\nDataset ready for model training\nAI model development workflow for social and professional matches including personally curated follow up\nDefinition of successful match (today with MVP, match rating is based on an algorithm  we defined that leads to the creation of a  good match, with no implementation of feedback loop. With user feedback, we need to consider user biases for good/bad match - and we need to further develop it and decide the weight given to each consideration (experiment with it))\nWhat infrastructure or platforms do you plan to use to support the development of this project?: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Vector-provided infrastructure (if applicable)\nIn one or two sentences, describe the ideal MLA candidate for this project.: technically strong AI practitioner with hands-on expertise in large language models (LLMs), natural language processing, data cleaning, and model fine-tuning.

    "qa_consolidated": "Project Summary: Describe the key business problem(s) or opportunity this project addresses. Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: Company 11, through its RISTs platform (Real-Time Immersive Simulation Training), is tackling critical workforce shortages in Canada’s energy, nuclear, skilled trades, and emergency response sectors. Current training methods rely on static classrooms and non-adaptive simulations that fail to address individual learning differences. Our solution deploys Agentic AI-driven non-player characters (NPCs) capable of reasoning, planning, and adapting their behaviour in real time by integrating Cognitive3D telemetry (motion, gaze, task flow), trainer dashboard inputs, and optional biometric signals (e.g., EEG headbands such as Muse) to capture attention, stress, and cognitive load. This multi-stream approach ensures NPCs respond dynamically while instructors retain oversight and actionable analytics. Trainees and instructors at Durham College’s CoreLab and partner TACs will use this system to accelerate onboarding, reduce errors, and improve retention. The Canadian nuclear sector alone faces 10,000+ skilled worker shortages by 2030, and the skilled trades are forecast to require over 700,000 new workers in the same timeframe, while the global simulation training market exceeds $11B. This project builds on prior work developed as Texture Dynamics (TDX) during Vector’s DaRMoD program, now formalized under Company 11’s RISTs division, ensuring continuity, technical maturity, and readiness for scale.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: Our objective is to develop a scalable proof-of-concept where Agentic AI-driven NPCs dynamically adapt to trainees in immersive training environments. These NPCs will reason, plan, and adjust behaviours in real time by integrating Cognitive3D telemetry (motion, gaze, task flow), trainer dashboard inputs, and optional biometric signals such as EEG headbands (e.g., Muse) to capture attention, stress, and cognitive load. The goal is to enhance decision support for instructors, reduce training time, and improve knowledge retention across the energy, nuclear, skilled trades, and emergency response sectors.\n\nKey milestones are staged across two phases. AI Readiness (Oct–Nov 2025): finalize use case with Durham MRC and Cognitive3D, define evaluation metrics, complete dataset inventory, and deliver an AI Solution Roadmap. Execution (Jan–May 2026): develop NPC Prototype v1 with dialogue and short-term memory, advance to NPC v2 with multi-step reasoning and telemetry integration, deploy the system in Durham’s CoreLab with instructors and students, and conclude with a packaged NPC + dashboard module and evaluation report for scaling across TAC sites.\n\nIf delayed or not implemented, training programs will remain static, costly, and slow to deliver, leaving employers unable to meet urgent workforce demand. This increases safety risks, extends onboarding time, and widens gaps in critical sectors already facing acute labour shortages.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool. Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: We expect the cohort to deliver a functional proof-of-concept that integrates Agentic AI-driven NPCs with real-time data streams and instructor oversight. Specific deliverables include:\n•\tNPC Prototype: An adaptive NPC agent with dialogue, short-term memory, and multi-step reasoning, fine-tuned on training dialogues and SOPs.\n•\tTelemetry Integration: Real-time ingestion of Cognitive3D motion/gaze/task flow data, plus extensibility for trainer dashboard inputs and biometric signals (e.g., EEG).\n•\tTrainer Dashboard v1: A live monitoring and analytics tool where instructors can observe NPC–trainee interactions and review post-session metrics.\n•\tReusable Module: A packaged NPC + dashboard system that can be deployed at CoreLab Durham and extended to partner TAC sites.\n•\tEvaluation Report: Metrics on training time reduction, error rates, and engagement improvements, validated through instructor feedback and Cognitive3D analytics.\n\nThese outputs will demonstrate feasibility, provide instructors with actionable tools, and establish a foundation for scaling across trades and energy training environments.\nWho will be the primary users of this solution? Please identify key internal or external user groups (e.g., analysts, customers, clinicians, etc.).: Trainees and apprentices in immersive energy, nuclear, and skilled trades programs, including learners from Indigenous, rural, and equity-seeking communities.    \tInstructors and training supervisors at Durham College’s CoreLab and partner TACs who use the trainer dashboard to monitor, assess, and guide learners.    \t•\tEmployer partners (utilities, construction unions, emergency response organizations) who require scalable, adaptive training solutions to accelerate workforce readiness. Applied research partners (Durham MRC, Conestoga SMART Centre, Cambrian, La Cité) who will validate, refine, and extend deployment across multiple training environments.\nHow will this solution integrate with your existing operations or product offerings?: Enhancement to an existing system\nPlease describe the dataset(s) you intend to use for this project.: Dataset(s) Description:\n1.\tContent & relevance: Dialogue datasets from existing immersive training modules (trainee–instructor exchanges, NPC scripts); domain-specific materials such as nuclear SOPs, safety manuals, and emergency procedures; motion and behaviour datasets (e.g., M-Body project and open-source corpora) for human movement; and real-time telemetry streams (motion, gaze, task flow) via Cognitive3D. These datasets are directly relevant for modelling NPC reasoning, adaptive responses, and evaluating trainee performance.\n2.\tSources: Internal training dialogues developed within RISTs modules; structured SOPs and manuals provided by sector partners; open-source human motion datasets and M-Body project contributions; Cognitive3D’s telemetry platform integrated in immersive environments.\n3.\tCollection & format: SOPs/manuals are structured text; dialogues are semi-structured scripts in tabular/text format; open-source motion datasets in JSON/CSV; Cognitive3D telemetry in structured real-time event streams (JSON).\n4.\tKey features: Dialogue turns, task flow steps, safety procedures, gaze vectors, movement traces, completion times, attention markers, error events.\n5.\tSize: Training dialogues (~5,000+ annotated exchanges, growing); SOP/manual corpus (~hundreds of documents); motion datasets (tens of thousands of records across multiple subjects); Cognitive3D telemetry (millions of events collected per training session, continuous stream).\nWhat is the current state of readiness of this dataset?: Partially annotated\nDoes the dataset contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII): False\nPlease describe how PII is handled or anonymized:: \nHow do you plan to evaluate the model or system’s performance?: Our evaluation framework will be co-designed with instructors and sector partners to ensure outcomes are meaningful and measurable. We will establish pre- and post-training benchmarks (time-to-completion, error rates, knowledge retention) and map them against NPC interactions and telemetry signals. Trainers will be able to associate specific NPC behaviors with individual learner progress, creating the foundation for each trainee’s personalized learning LLM.\n\nThe plan includes:\n•\tA golden set of scripted training interactions to provide a baseline.\n•\tHuman-in-the-loop validation by instructors at Durham MRC’s RISTs CoreLab.\n•\tTelemetry analytics (engagement, gaze, task flow, error frequency) via Cognitive3D.\n•\tInstructor dashboards to capture live feedback and post-session review.\n•\tIndustry observation: OPG’s training department will be invited to review late-stage pilots and comment on industry relevance.\n\nRather than fix arbitrary numeric goals now, success will be defined by measurable improvement between pre- and post-training benchmarks, instructor validation, and alignment with industry training standards.\nHave you already explored or are you considering techniques associated with Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for this use case? If so, please specify which specific models or approaches used or are under consideration.: Yes. We are actively exploring generative AI and LLM-based techniques for this use case. Specifically, we plan to fine-tune open-source models such as Mistral and Llama-2/3, augmented with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines built on LangChain/AutoGen. These models will be trained on domain-specific SOPs, safety manuals, and annotated training dialogues to power NPC reasoning and dialogue. We are also considering lightweight fine-tuning methods (LoRA/PEFT) to make models efficient for real-time interaction.\n\nIn parallel, we are designing an agentic architecture where NPCs use short-term and long-term memory modules, allowing them to reason across multi-step tasks while adapting to telemetry signals (motion, gaze, task flow). The MLA cohort will help refine this orchestration and ensure responsible use of generative AI in immersive training.\nAre there any ethical, legal, or societal considerations related to the use of Generative AI or autonomous agents in this context? (e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): Yes. We are addressing several ethical, legal, and societal considerations as part of this project:\n•\tFairness & Bias: NPC behaviour will be validated with input from instructors and advisors representing diverse learner groups, including Indigenous and equity-seeking communities in the trades.\n•\tTransparency & Trust: All NPC interactions will be auditable. Trainers can review decisions in real time via the dashboard, ensuring human oversight and avoiding “black box” AI.\n•\tData Privacy: No personally identifiable information (PII) is used. All datasets are synthetic, anonymized, or derived from non-sensitive training content. Biometric signals, if integrated, will be optional and fully consent-based.\n•\tHuman-Centric Design: NPCs are designed to augment, not replace instructors. The system strengthens trainer effectiveness while ensuring learners remain guided by qualified humans.\n•\tResponsible AI Principles: We are aligning with Canadian standards for responsible AI (fairness, accountability, transparency, safety), and we will continue engaging applied research, training, and community advisors to ensure societal values are embedded throughout development.\nHow will you measure success for this project? Please include any baseline metrics, KPIs, or qualitative outcomes you hope to observe.: Success will be measured through a combination of baseline metrics, instructor validation, and learner outcomes. We will establish pre- and post-training benchmarks (time-to-completion, error rates, knowledge retention) and compare improvements once NPCs and dashboards are integrated. Instructor dashboards and Cognitive3D analytics will provide quantitative measures of engagement, task accuracy, and attention. Human-in-the-loop validation will ensure NPC behaviour supports learning goals and aligns with training standards.\n\nBy operating within the RISTs CoreLab, we can iterate measurements in a controlled environment, refining evaluation criteria with instructors and learners until they align with the expectations of industry partners such as OPG and Bruce Power, trade unions, and regulators including nuclear safety commissions. This approach ensures outcomes are not only technically valid but also match the compliance and workforce readiness needs of safety-critical sectors.\n\nUltimately, success will be demonstrated by measurable improvements against baseline training results, combined with validation from instructors, industry partners, and regulatory stakeholders that the solution is ready for scaling.\nWhat infrastructure or platforms do you plan to use to support the development of this project?: Internal on-premise or virtual private servers, Vector-provided infrastructure (if applicable), Open-source or public tools (e.g., Colab, Hugging Face, Weights & Biases), Google Cloud Platform (GCP)\nIn one or two sentences, describe the ideal MLA candidate for this project.: The ideal candidate for this project would have experience with LLM fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), along with skills in simulation/NPC modelling, real-time data integration, and multimodal AI (e.g., video/vision analysis and speech/voice generation). Familiarity with tools such as LangChain, Hugging Face, Unity, and telemetry platforms would be valuable. The candidate will work as part of the RISTs CoreLab team, collaborating with developers, instructors, and industry partners to apply AI in immersive training and workforce development contexts.\nPlease describe your technical team (if any). Include the number of staff and relevant roles (e.g., ML engineers, data analysts, product managers, etc.).: Our technical capacity is structured around a lean internal team supported by strong applied research and industry partners. The team includes an immersive developer, a backend engineer, and an AI/ML technical lead guiding model development and data strategy.\n\nThe RISTs CoreLab @ Durham MRC/AI Hub will provide an additional AI layer during the MLA use case, ensuring integration with applied research. Cognitive3D is also contributing in-kind support and deploying their telemetry/analytics solution within CoreLab, giving us access to their platform and AI expertise.\n\nWe are prepared to bridge resources and shuffle financial priorities to ensure the MLA engagement is fully supported, even if external funding timelines shift. This approach, combined with consulting revenue opportunities and IRAP support already in development, ensures we can sustain the work and expand into a dedicated team in 2026.\nIs there any additional context or background information you would like to provide to help us evaluate your use case application?: Company 11 RISTs is building a replicable CoreLab model for immersive training, starting with energy and nuclear and expanding to trades and other safety-critical sectors. The MLA engagement will accelerate the development of our AI/NPC engine and help establish success criteria that align with industry and regulatory partners.\n\nThis work directly connects to our Skills Development Fund (SDF) focus and ongoing engagement with energy sector companies (OPG, Bruce Power) and trade unions (CBTU) to shape workforce training initiatives. By aligning AI-enabled training with both employer and labour needs, we ensure solutions are technically sound, industry-relevant, and workforce-validated.\n\nWe are supported by partnerships with Durham MRC/AI Hub, Conestoga SMART Centre, and Cognitive3D, with in-kind contributions and applied research resources already in place. As founder and technical lead, I am committed to bridging resources and shuffling priorities to ensure MLA success.\n\nThis timing is perfect within our R&D roadmap, providing the missing AI layer to RISTs CoreLab activities and positioning us to scale into larger SDF, IRAP, and industry-backed initiatives.\nUnnamed: 18: \nUnnamed: 19: \nUnnamed: 20: \nUnnamed: 21: \nUnnamed: 22: \nUnnamed: 23: \nUnnamed: 24: \nUnnamed: 25: \nUnnamed: 26: \nUnnamed: 27: \nUnnamed: 28: \nUnnamed: 29: \nUnnamed: 30: \nUnnamed: 31: \nUnnamed: 32: \nUnnamed: 33: \nUnnamed: 34: \nUnnamed: 35: \nUnnamed: 36: \nUnnamed: 37: \nUnnamed: 38: \nUnnamed: 39: \nUnnamed: 40: \nUnnamed: 41: \nUnnamed: 42: \nUnnamed: 43: "

    "qa_consolidated": "Project Summary: Describe the key business problem(s) or opportunity this project addresses. Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: “Current practices of phenotypic term extraction in the absence of automation are labor-intensive and put a significant burden on subject matter experts in the diagnostic lab. This is inherently at odds with the increasing utilization of genomic sequencing across many healthcare specialties which requires scalability of solutions to meet market demands.” (Albayrak et al 2025) \n\nGenomic medicine is entering mainstream care, but interpretation remains the bottleneck: accurate variant analysis depends on structured phenotypic data, yet requisitions are often incomplete, unstructured, and still on paper. Additionally, manual entry of features and symptoms as Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) codes, the preferred format for laboratory analytics platforms, are slow and inconsistently reported by clinicians, delaying care and limiting scale. \n\nOur solution, SmartRequisition, is an AI-powered phenotyping engine that automatically extracts HPO terms from multimodal sources (3D scans, dictation, free text) and outputs structured, lab-ready requisitions. Integrated within Company 12s’ clinical genomics workflow software, the tool reduces clinician burden, ensures high-quality requisition data ready for downstream analysis, and accelerates genetic test interpretation.\n\nImpact:\nClinicians → reduced burden of data entry.\nLaboratories → structured requisitions that improve test accuracy.\nPatients → faster, more accurate diagnoses.\n\nThe focus of the Vector Fastlane 4-month project will be building the clinician-in-the-loop UI and developing an AI model that continuously learns from this feedback, directly tackling clinician burden and ensuring more accurate, structured requisitions.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: SmartRequisition is part of a two‑year larger project vision with clinical rollouts at hospitals across the county. However, within the shorter Fastlane 4-month timeline, we will concentrate on a subset of the project goals, specifically advancing the clinician-in-the-loop UI and developing an AI model that continuously learns from this feedback. The Fastlane project will:\n\n1. Build the clinician‑in‑the‑loop UI to enable validation and feedback on AI suggestions.\n\n2. Deliver an AI model that continuously/regularly learns from this feedback, ensuring measurable improvement over time.\n\n3. Enable multi‑modal extraction, including free text, clinician note uploads, and dictation.\n\n4. Produce a functional prototype integrating backend pipeline and clinician interface.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool. Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: Within the 4-month Vector Fastlane cohort, the focus will be on producing a functional prototype of SmartRequisition that builds on our existing Vector Fastlane prototype. This includes a RAG-based pipeline for HPO extraction from free text, clinician note uploads, and dictation, with performance targets of ≥81% precision, ≥.76 recall, and ≥0.78 F1-score. A clinician-in-the-loop UI will enable users to review, validate, and provide feedback on AI-suggested terms, while adaptive learning capabilities will ensure the model continuously improves from this input. An integration-ready backend will demonstrate how structured, lab-ready requisitions can be output for downstream analysis.\nWho will be the primary users of this solution? Please identify key internal or external user groups (e.g., analysts, customers, clinicians, etc.).: Clinicians and geneticists completing genomic test requisitions.\nHow will this solution integrate with your existing operations or product offerings?: Enhancement to an existing system\nPlease describe the dataset(s) you intend to use for this project.: CHU-50 Dataset: \nContents & Relevance: 50 curated, de-identified clinical summaries that have been manually coded with HPO terms. These are particularly challenging cases, making them valuable for stress-testing the extraction model.\nSource: Partner access\nFormat: Unstructured clinical text paired with structured HPO annotations.\nKey Features: Narrative summaries of patient histories, symptoms, and clinical observations; corresponding HPO-coded phenotypic terms.\nSize: 50 records, highly curated and high value for benchmarking.\n\nSynthetic Rare Disease Dataset (Generated via GenAI)\nContents & Relevance: Synthetic clinical notes generated from ~6,000 example rare disease cases. Provides scale for developing and refining extraction pipelines without exposing sensitive patient data.\nSource: Synthetic data generation using LLM-based tools seeded with open clinical knowledge bases.\nFormat: Free-text clinical notes with phenotype descriptors; paired with automatically or semi-automatically generated HPO annotations.\nKey Features: Phenotype descriptions, demographic context, clinical indications.\nSize: ~6,000 synthetic records.\n\nReference Knowledge Bases\nHuman Phenotype Ontology (HPO): Open-source ontology (>15,000 phenotype terms) used as the target vocabulary for extraction.\nOther Genetics Resources (e.g., ClinVar, Orphanet, OMIM, Monarch Initiative): Structured phenotype-genotype associations used to augment model accuracy.\nWhat is the current state of readiness of this dataset?: Fully labeled for ML tasks\nDoes the dataset contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII): False\nPlease describe how PII is handled or anonymized:: \nHow do you plan to evaluate the model or system’s performance?: Evaluation will combine benchmarking, clinician validation, heuristics, and continuous monitoring. \n\nWe will use the CHU-50 dataset as a gold standard, targeting ≥81% precision, ≥.76 recall, and ≥0.78 F1-score, and validate consistency across ~6,000 synthetic rare disease cases to test robustness across free text, notes, and dictation. \n\nClinicians will provide feedback through a prototype UI that allows them to accept, reject, or edit AI-suggested terms, with metrics such as acceptance rates, correction times, and usability feedback. \n\nHeuristics like confidence thresholds and plausibility checks will reduce errors, while dashboards will track accuracy, feedback trends, and iterative model improvement over time.\nHave you already explored or are you considering techniques associated with Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for this use case? If so, please specify which specific models or approaches used or are under consideration.: Yes. SmartRequisition leverages techniques from Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to support accurate extraction of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms from clinical text. \n\nSpecific approaches for this project include: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline, Generative AI for Synthetic Data Augmentation and Evaluating multi-modal LLMs for handling dictation and note uploads alongside free-text.\nAre there any ethical, legal, or societal considerations related to the use of Generative AI or autonomous agents in this context? (e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): Yes. Patient privacy is protected by keeping all raw data under hospital custodianship and using only de-identified or synthetic data for development. Bias risks are addressed by incorporating diverse datasets, while transparency is ensured by grounding outputs in the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and allowing clinicians to review and edit AI suggestions. The system is an assistive tool, not a replacement for clinical judgment, supporting user trust. Development follows applicable privacy laws (PHIPA, HIPAA, GDPR) and Canadian ethical standards (TCPS2), ensuring compliance and societal acceptability.\nHow will you measure success for this project? Please include any baseline metrics, KPIs, or qualitative outcomes you hope to observe.: For the 4‑month Vector Fastlane cohort, success will focus on advancing the clinician-in-the-loop UI and developing an AI model that continuously learns from this feedback\n\nKey indicators include:\n\nModel Accuracy: Build on existing prototype. Demonstrate ≥81% precision, ≥.76 recall, and ≥0.78 F1‑score for HPO term extraction using the CHU‑50 benchmark dataset and synthetic rare disease cases.\n\nClinician Feedback Loop: Deliver a functional prototype where clinicians can accept, reject, or edit AI suggestions, with measurable feedback on usability and trust.\n\nLearning from Feedback: Show evidence that the model improves with iterative clinician input (e.g., reduction in edit rates across evaluation rounds).\n\nMulti‑modal Support: Successful extraction of HPO terms from at least two input types (free text + clinician notes or dictation).\nWhat infrastructure or platforms do you plan to use to support the development of this project?: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Internal on-premise or virtual private servers, Open-source or public tools (e.g., Colab, Hugging Face, Weights & Biases), Microsoft Azure\nIn one or two sentences, describe the ideal MLA candidate for this project.: The ideal candidate for this project would have experience with NLP, LLMs, and RAG pipelines, ideally applied to biomedical text, along with skills in prompt engineering, model evaluation, clinician-in-the-loop systems, and prototype UI development.\nPlease describe your technical team (if any).

Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: We envision the deliverable as a functional prototype, though the MLA will not be responsible for developing the front-end components, just the NLP and how it interfaces with our backend. Specifically, this will be a conversational agent that can help access different views of our CRM software (e.g. \"show me all media interactions from 2025 from Forestry that had to do with wildfires\"), our analytics (e.g. \"show me a piechart of media interactions with Canadian outlets versus international in 2024\"), and will help with drafting documents based on contents of our CRM (e.g. \"make me a media release for this story with a similar style to prior releases about similar topics\").\nWho will be the primary users of this solution? Please identify key internal or external user groups (e.g., analysts, customers, clinicians, etc.).: External users - Communications directors and their media relations teams\nHow will this solution integrate with your existing operations or product offerings?: Enhancement to an existing system\nPlease describe the dataset(s) you intend to use for this project.: 1) What the dataset contains and its relevance to the use case.\n\nThe dataset will be any relevant data within our web application, including all CRM data collected over the past five years. We may restrict the data to a certain client (tenant). \n\n2) Source(s) of the dataset (e.g., internal CRM, third-party APIs, web scraping, user-generated input, etc.).\n\nData is either user-generated/entered, or scraped from emails by our existing AI tooling. \n\n3) How the data was collected and its current format (structured, unstructured, tabular, text, etc.).\n\nMost data is structured, within MongoDB. There are also stored unstructured documents, including emails and docx/pdf that represent media relation specialist outputs. \n\n4) Indicate the key features or fields present in the dataset.\n\n\n5) Approximate size (e.g., number of records, file size, time range).\n\nEntries in our CRM (Services, Media Interactions, Engagements) number >10,000. These are primarily from the last 3 years, though some entries go back 5 years in total.\n\nThis is the data point to correct from last submission: We have over 100,000 client records that we can use for AI and data analysis\nWhat is the current state of readiness of this dataset?: Partially annotated\nDoes the dataset contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII): False\nPlease describe how PII is handled or anonymized:: \nHow do you plan to evaluate the model or system’s performance?: For all tasks, we will create expected question-answer pairs that will include scenarios, example user input, and the expected output (or more specifically, the expected filtering that should be applied to the data). For the CRM data filtering tasks, this can be a somewhat quantitative/automated, as we can set up an evaluation system that can look at the input and the filter output. This will also be the case for applying analytics e.g. building a certain pie chart. \n\nFor document generation, this will be a bit more complicated. As it will be a RAG system, we could quantitatively evaluate the document retrieval e.g. if with a certain user input, we can check that certain relevant documents are being retrieved to use for drafting the output document. We will also want to evaluate the final drafted document, which will be qualitatively assessed by a human expert - we would have such raters readily available to help measure performance, and are happy to help develop an evaluation scheme (correctness, relevance, safety, etc).\nHave you already explored or are you considering techniques associated with Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for this use case? If so, please specify which specific models or approaches used or are under consideration.: We have a current initial AI system that uses LLaMA 3 with some prompting and few shot learning to scrape structured data from emails. This is deployed on Amazon Bedrock. This system is working quite well and could be used as a foundation/influence for this much more complex project.\nAre there any ethical, legal, or societal considerations related to the use of Generative AI or autonomous agents in this context? (e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): Regular data privacy concerns that any enterprise has with cloud based systems\nHow will you measure success for this project? Please include any baseline metrics, KPIs, or qualitative outcomes you hope to observe.: Utilization rate by clients\nWhat infrastructure or platforms do you plan to use to support the development of this project?: Amazon Web Services (AWS)\nIn one or two sentences, describe the ideal MLA candidate for this project.: The ideal candidate would have experience and interest in NLP pipelines used for predictive, generative, and extractive tasks, and be comfortable working with a mix of both structured and unstructured data. They would enjoy collaborating with our front end/backend developers to integrate the NLP pipeline into out software so that their work could be integrated promptly. A nice-to-have would be familiarity with AWS or a similar system as that’s how we’ve currently deployed our NLP tool, but we would be happy to introduce them to our system.\nPlease describe your technical team (if any). Include the number of staff and relevant roles (e.g., ML engineers, data analysts, product managers, etc.).: Three software developers plus our CTO, who is an an AI researcher with a background in NLP. Occasionally we engage co-op students also\nIs there any additional context or background information you would like to provide to help us evaluate your use case application?: 1) What the dataset contains and its relevance to the use case.\n\nThe dataset will be any relevant data within our web application, including all CRM data collected over the past five years.

    "qa_consolidated": "Project Summary: Describe the key business problem(s) or opportunity this project addresses. Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: The Cognitive Coach AI addresses a critical challenge in the eldercare and healthcare industry: the rising need for effective, personalized cognitive support for older adults experiencing cognitive decline, particularly mild cognitive impairment (MCI). As the aging population grows, caregivers—often family members—face mounting stress and uncertainty in providing consistent, meaningful engagement for their loved ones. This AI-driven agent offers an opportunity to transform caregiving by enabling the creation of daily, individualized cognitive stimulation plans, including memory games, conversations, and adaptive exercises.\n\nTargeting both informal caregivers and clinical professionals, the solution not only reduces caregiver burden but also enhances the autonomy and cognitive engagement of older adults. In addition, it delivers valuable insights to clinicians, supporting earlier interventions and potentially delaying the progression of cognitive decline. Operating within the eldercare and digital health industries—markets that are expanding rapidly and increasingly influenced by regulatory oversight—the Cognitive Coach AI offers a scalable, tech-enabled approach to improving quality of life and care outcomes.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: Objectives:\n\nBuild a New Product (Cognitive Coach AI MVP):\nDevelop a functional minimum viable product that enables users (caregivers) to generate personalized cognitive stimulation plans tailored to an older adult’s cognitive profile.\n\nAutomate a Manual and Stressful Process:\nReplace the current ad-hoc or manual creation of activity plans with an AI-driven system that automates plan generation based on cognitive profiles, preferences, and progress tracking.\n\nEnable Exporting to PDF for Easy Sharing:\nProvide a user-friendly feature to export cognitive stimulation plans in PDF format, making it easy to share with family members or healthcare professionals.\n\nImprove Decision Support for Caregivers and Clinicians:\nOffer actionable insights based on user data to help caregivers make better daily decisions and assist clinicians in monitoring and adjusting care strategies.\n\nSuccess Milestones:\n\nUser Onboarding Flow Implemented:\nCaregivers can create a user profile and input cognitive characteristics of the older adult.\n\nPlan Generation Engine Functional:\nAI-generated daily cognitive stimulation plans (including games, exercises, and conversation topics) based on the profile.\n\nPDF Export Capability Working:\nUsers can export the generated plan in a clean, professional PDF format suitable for offline use and sharing.\n\nUser Testing with Initial Feedback:\nMVP is tested with a sample group of caregivers; feedback is collected for usability, usefulness, and quality of generated plans.\n\nClinician Review Functionality (Optional for MVP):\nBasic functionality for clinicians to view or receive reports from caregivers, potentially guiding future iterations.\n\nImportance of the Project:\n\nConsequences of Not Solving the Problem:\n\nCaregivers will continue to experience high levels of stress, uncertainty, and time burden when supporting older adults with cognitive decline.\n\nOlder adults may receive inconsistent or suboptimal cognitive engagement, potentially accelerating cognitive deterioration.\n\nClinicians will lack timely, structured insights into patient engagement and cognitive changes outside clinical settings.\n\nImpact of Delay:\n\nMissing the opportunity to establish early user adoption and feedback in a rapidly growing eldercare tech market.\n\nDelayed validation of the solution’s value proposition, potentially slowing down funding, partnerships, or regulatory approval processes.\n\nCompetitive risk as other solutions emerge in the cognitive health support space.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool. Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: Within the scope of the cohort, the goal is to deliver a functional and testable MVP that integrates seamlessly into the existing Company 14 Core UI, enabling users (caregivers) to generate personalized cognitive stimulation plans.

Qualitative Indicators of Success\n\nCaregiver testimonials (reduced uncertainty, easier planning).\n\nClinician endorsements (plans align with standard of care).\n\nAdoption metrics: repeat use, number of exported PDFs per week.\n\nCaregiver retention: willingness to continue using after MVP trial.\nHave you already explored or are you considering techniques associated with Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for this use case? If so, please specify which specific models or approaches used or are under consideration.: Yes — we are actively considering generative AI and LLM techniques for this use case. Specifically:\n\nInstruction-tuned LLMs (GPT-4, LLaMA-2, Mistral) for personalized plan generation.\n\nDomain-specific fine-tuning with cognitive profile + activity datasets.\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground outputs in evidence-based caregiver resources.\n\nMulti-agent design to separate profiling, plan generation, and formatting.\n\nSafety guardrails + human-in-the-loop validation to ensure trustworthiness.\n\nExplored / Under Consideration\n\nInstruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs):\n\nCandidates: GPT-4, LLaMA-2, Mistral-7B/13B, Falcon, and fine-tuned variants on healthcare/eldercare data.\n\nRelevance: These models are effective at generating structured text (e.g., personalized daily plans, conversation prompts, caregiver summaries).\n\nApproach: Use a base model, then fine-tune or prompt-engineer with domain-specific datasets (e.g., cognitive assessment data, evidence-based activity libraries).\n\nDomain-specific Fine-Tuning / Instruction Alignment:\n\nBuild a synthetic dataset combining (A) cognitive profiles (from NCPT, ELSA, CoSoWELL, etc.) with (B) cognitive stimulation plan examples (from Cochrane reviews, serious games, caregiver manuals).\n\nFine-tune model to learn the mapping: profile → personalized plan.\n\nUse instruction-response pairs:\n\nInstruction: Generate a cognitive plan for an 80-year-old with mild memory impairment, who enjoys music and gardening.  \nResponse: [plan with memory game, music therapy, gardening conversation topic].  \n\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\n\nStore a knowledge base of clinically validated activity templates (from caregiver orgs, Cochrane, dementia activity guides).\n\nLLM generates plans by retrieving relevant activities for a given profile, ensuring evidence-based grounding and avoiding hallucinations.\n\nMulti-Agent / Modular Design:\n\nAgent 1: Profile Builder – generates structured 360° cognitive profile from caregiver inputs.\n\nAgent 2: Plan Generator – maps profile → tailored stimulation plan.\n\nAgent 3: Output Formatter – packages plan into a clean PDF for caregiver/clinician use.\n\nEach agent could be implemented as an LLM prompt pipeline or microservice behind an API/MCP server.\n\nEvaluation / Safety Enhancements:\n\nUse rule-based guardrails (heuristics layered on top of LLM output) to ensure suggested activities are safe, appropriate, and balanced (e.g., no physically demanding activities for frail users).\n\nOptionally integrate human-in-the-loop review for clinician validation during pilot phase.\nAre there any ethical, legal, or societal considerations related to the use of Generative AI or autonomous agents in this context? (e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): Yes, there are important considerations in deploying generative AI in this space:\n\nPrivacy & compliance (PHIPA/HIPAA).\n\nBias & fairness (cultural, linguistic inclusivity).\n\nSafety guardrails to prevent harmful suggestions.\n\nTransparency & trust (explainable recommendations, caregiver control).\n\nLegal framing as a supportive tool, not diagnostic.\n\nAddressing these upfront will ensure trust, adoption, and compliance, while aligning with the project’s mission of supporting caregivers and older adults ethically.\n\nEthical, Legal, and Societal Considerations\n1. Data Privacy & Security\n\nIssue: Cognitive health data (e.g., memory scores, daily activities) is highly sensitive and may qualify as personal health information (PHI) under HIPAA (U.S.) or PHIPA (Ontario).\n\nMitigation:\n\nEncrypt all stored and transmitted data.\n\nUse anonymization/pseudonymization where possible.\n\nStore data in compliance with local regulations (e.g., Canadian servers for Ontario users).\n\nExplicit caregiver and patient consent before data use.\n\n2. Fairness & Bias\n\nIssue: LLMs may embed cultural, language, or demographic biases that could produce irrelevant or insensitive activity suggestions (e.g., Western-centric conversation topics not suited for multicultural Ontario).\n\nMitigation:\n\nCurate training/fine-tuning data with cultural and linguistic diversity in mind.\n\nIncorporate user customization fields (e.g., preferred language, cultural background, hobbies).\n\nPeriodic audits of output to detect systemic biases.\n\n3. Safety & Clinical Appropriateness\n\nIssue: AI-generated activities must not put older adults at risk (e.g., suggesting strenuous exercises for someone with mobility issues).\n\nMitigation:\n\nApply rule-based guardrails (e.g., only low-impact activities for frail or mobility-limited users).\n\nHuman-in-the-loop validation by clinicians during pilot phase.\n\nClear disclaimers that this is a support tool, not a replacement for medical advice.\n\n4. Transparency & Explainability\n\nIssue: Caregivers and clinicians may distrust “black-box” AI recommendations if they cannot see why an activity was suggested.\n\nMitigation:\n\nProvide explanations alongside plans (e.g., “This activity was suggested because it supports memory recall and matches the user’s interest in gardening”).\n\nShow links to validated sources (Cochrane reviews, caregiver guides) when applicable.\n\n5. User Trust & Autonomy\n\nIssue: Caregivers must feel the AI supports, not replaces, their judgment. Older adults must not feel infantilized or stigmatized.\n\nMitigation:\n\nPosition AI as a care partner tool that reduces caregiver stress.\n\nAllow caregivers to edit, reject, or customize plans easily.\n\nInvolve caregivers and older adults in co-design to ensure usability and dignity.\n\n6. Legal & Regulatory Compliance\n\nIssue: Depending on positioning, the solution may fall under digital health tool regulations.\n\nMitigation:\n\nMVP framed as a care support tool, not a diagnostic device.\n\nMonitor evolving guidance on AI in healthcare (e.g., FDA’s digital health framework, Health Canada’s SaMD regulations).\nHow will you measure success for this project? Please include any baseline metrics, KPIs, or qualitative outcomes you hope to observe.: 1. Baseline Metrics (Before MVP Deployment)\n\nCaregiver Stress Levels: Use validated tools such as the Zarit Burden Interview (short form) or OCO survey benchmarks (e.g., 58% of Ontario caregivers report burnout).\n\nEngagement Gaps: % of caregivers reporting uncertainty about how to keep loved ones cognitively engaged.\n\nClinician Insight Gap: % of clinicians reporting limited visibility into daily cognitive activities outside of appointments.\n\n2.

    "qa_consolidated": "Project Summary: Describe the key business problem(s) or opportunity this project addresses. Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: Company 15 is tackling one of the most fundamental challenges in scaling computer vision: inconsistent, low-quality image capture. Without high-quality, standardized data, AI models fail to deliver accurate results, slowing adoption across industries that depend on visual workflows.\n\nOur solution is an agentic, browser-native capture co-pilot that runs directly in a user’s browser (via WASM + Rust) and leverages quantized language models (QLMs) for on-device reasoning. The system detects issues such as blur, poor lighting, framing errors, and missing coverage, then generates adaptive, context-aware prompts in real time to guide users toward valid captures.\n\nIn parallel, Company 15 is developing 3D-to-2D alignment capabilities that transform sequential image captures into standardized inspection-ready views. This ensures every session yields a structured dataset suitable for downstream AI pipelines.\n\nTarget industries and audience:\n\n- Fleets & logistics (drivers, fleet managers)\n- Automotive remarketing (auction operators, dealerships)\n- Insurance & warranty (claims adjusters, inspectors)\n- Marketplaces & digital retail (merchants, operations teams)\n\nThe global automotive and logistics markets alone exceed $5T in value, with billions of images captured annually for inspections, resale, claims, and compliance. Today, 20–40% of captures require rework. By embedding agentic AI directly at the point of capture, Company 15 addresses this bottleneck and enables faster, cheaper, and more scalable AI adoption.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: The main objective is to deliver a pilot-ready, browser-native agentic capture co-pilot that ensures every vehicle inspection session achieves complete coverage and outputs standardized 2D views from a 3D-aware pipeline.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1) Automate capture quality and coverage assurance with an in-browser agent that detects blur, glare, angle, and coverage gaps, providing adaptive real-time guidance.\n\n2) Integrate with Company 15’s 3D engine to pass captured images into a reconstruction pipeline, validating whether full vehicle coverage has been achieved.\n\n3) Standardize capture outputs by generating 3D-to-2D aligned views with confidence scoring for downstream AI models.\n\n4) Deliver a pilot-ready prototype embedded in Company 15’s WASP interface that enterprises can deploy directly for real-world testing.\n\nSuccess Milestones (within cohort timeframe):\n\nMilestone 1 – Browser-Native Agentic Guidance (Month 1–2): Deploy QLM-driven agent inside WASP to provide frame-level quality feedback; target ≥30% reduction in failed captures.\n\nMilestone 2 – Coverage Reasoning + 3D Engine Integration (Month 2–3): Enhance the agent to reason about overall vehicle coverage and feed sequential captures into the 3D engine for validation, ensuring ≥80% body coverage with ≤10% missed zones.\n\nMilestone 3 – 3D-to-2D Alignment Prototype (Month 3–4): Output standardized 2D inspection views from validated 3D reconstructions with pose deviation ≤10° and ≥90% coverage completeness.\n\nMilestone 4 – Pilot-Ready Prototype & Evaluation (Final Deliverable): Fully integrated agent + 3D pipeline, benchmarked for low latency (<500 ms feedback), accompanied by metrics dashboard, validation datasets, and pilot deployment guide.\n\nImportance and Consequences of Delay:\nWithout this solution, enterprises will continue to suffer from incomplete and inconsistent capture datasets, with 20–40% of inspections requiring rework. This undermines trust in AI inspection workflows, increases costs, and slows deployment across fleets, automotive remarketing, and insurance. Failure to integrate coverage reasoning and 3D validation now would leave a critical gap, preventing Company 15 from achieving pilot readiness and ceding early leadership in agentic capture orchestration.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool. Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: The goal is to deliver a pilot-ready, browser-native capture co-pilot that ensures complete, high-quality vehicle coverage and generates standardized 2D views from a 3D-aware pipeline.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1) Automate capture quality and coverage assurance by embedding a lightweight agent in Company 15’s WASP interface.\n\n2) Pass captured images into Company 15’s 3D engine to validate coverage and reconstruct standardized views.\n\n3) Prove feasibility of running quantized language models (QLMs) in-browser via WASM for low-latency reasoning.\n\n4) Deliver a deployable prototype that enterprises can pilot immediately.\nWho will be the primary users of this solution? Please identify key internal or external user groups (e.g., analysts, customers, clinicians, etc.).: Frontline capture users (drivers, agents, technicians) and operational stakeholders (fleet managers, claims and remarketing teams) who rely on standardized, high-quality visual datasets.\nHow will this solution integrate with your existing operations or product offerings?: Enhancement to an existing system\nPlease describe the dataset(s) you intend to use for this project.: Company 15 will leverage a combination of proprietary capture validation data and publicly available vehicle specifications to power the agentic capture co-pilot and 3D-to-2D alignment pipeline.\n\nProprietary data: A labeled seed dataset of vehicle images tagged as acceptable vs rejected, with metadata for side, angle, and capture conditions. This provides immediate training signals for distinguishing valid vs invalid captures.\n\nPublic data: Vehicle specifications and dimensional attributes (length, width, height, wheelbase, panel layouts) from OEM registries, open datasets, and government sources. These references enable reasoning about full coverage and accurate pose alignment.\n\nFormat & Features:\n\nProprietary: High-resolution images (JPEG/PNG) with structured JSON metadata (timestamp, capture angle, vehicle side, pass/fail flag).\n\nPublic: Structured tabular data (CSV/JSON) containing vehicle make/model/year and dimensional attributes.\n\nScale:\n\nProprietary: Tens of thousands of labeled captures across multiple vehicle types (~1–2 TB including images and metadata).\n\nPublic: Thousands of vehicle entries spanning 10+ years of makes/models (<1 GB structured).\n\nTogether, these datasets provide the foundation for an agent that can both evaluate capture quality in real time and validate complete vehicle coverage against reliable dimensional references, ensuring the system is cohort-ready and pilot-ready.\nWhat is the current state of readiness of this dataset?: Partially annotated\nDoes the dataset contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII): False\nPlease describe how PII is handled or anonymized:: \nHow do you plan to evaluate the model or system’s performance?: We will combine quantitative benchmarks with side-by-side testing against existing capture tools:\n\nGolden dataset: Accuracy, precision, and recall on labeled acceptable vs rejected images.\n\nCoverage metrics: Pose deviation (°) and % completeness from 3D-to-2D validation.\n\nHuman-in-the-loop validation: Expert reviewers confirm outputs and flag edge cases.\n\nSide-by-side benchmark: Matched objects, devices, and routes to compare Company 15’s agentic capture against baseline tools. Metrics: reject rate, coverage completeness, latency, and time-to-complete capture.\n\nEfficiency target: Demonstrate ≥50% reduction in capture time while also cutting reject rates by ≥50%.\nHave you already explored or are you considering techniques associated with Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for this use case? If so, please specify which specific models or approaches used or are under consideration.: Yes. We are exploring quantized LLMs (QLMs) deployed in-browser via WASM for low-latency reasoning, adaptive feedback, and real-time guidance. Models like Mistral-7B and LLaMA 3.2 are under consideration, with RAG and prompt engineering supporting agentic decision-making and coverage validation.\nAre there any ethical, legal, or societal considerations related to the use of Generative AI or autonomous agents in this context? (e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): Yes. Our system is designed with responsible AI practices:\n\nData privacy: All capture data excludes personally identifiable information (PII). The 3D engine automatically applies license plate and face blurring to protect individuals before data is used for training or validation.\n\nFairness & bias: Models are trained on diverse datasets to avoid bias toward specific vehicles, environments, or conditions.\n\nTransparency & trust: The agent provides clear, explainable feedback (e.g., why a capture is rejected) rather than opaque decisions.\n\nHuman oversight: Edge cases are escalated for human review to ensure accountability.\n\nThese measures ensure Company 15’s agentic guidance system is safe, privacy-preserving, and trusted by end users.\nHow will you measure success for this project? Please include any baseline metrics, KPIs, or qualitative outcomes you hope to observe.: Success will be measured by:\n\n≥50% reduction in rejected captures.\n\n≥90% coverage completeness with ≤10° pose deviation.\n\n≥50% faster capture time per session.\n\nReal-time guidance (<500 ms latency) that works reliably offline or in low-connectivity environments.\nWhat infrastructure or platforms do you plan to use to support the development of this project?: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Open-source or public tools (e.g., Colab, Hugging Face, Weights & Biases), Vector-provided infrastructure (if applicable), Company-hosted development environment (e.g., GitLab, JupyterHub)\nIn one or two sentences, describe the ideal MLA candidate for this project.: The ideal candidate would have hands-on experience with LLMs and generative AI, plus familiarity with prompt engineering and lightweight model deployment. Strong skills in computer vision or multimodal AI, along with comfort using open-source tools (e.g., Hugging Face, PyTorch) for dataset preparation, evaluation, and experimentation, would be highly valuable.\nPlease describe your technical team (if any). Include the number of staff and relevant roles (e.g., ML engineers, data analysts, product managers, etc.).: Company 15’s team includes 3 core members:\n\nFounder & Product Lead (myself): Driving technical strategy, product roadmap, and integration of agentic AI into the WASP interface; experienced in leading applied AI projects from prototype to enterprise deployment.\n\n1 Full-Stack Developer: Skilled in both backend and frontend development, specializing in browser-native engineering (WASM/Rust), system integration, and user interface design.\n\n1 Data Analyst: Responsible for dataset preparation, annotation pipelines, and performance evaluation.\nIs there any additional context or background information you would like to provide to help us evaluate your use case application?: Company 15’s focus is on solving one of the most critical bottlenecks in applied computer vision: reliable, standardized image capture. Our approach combines browser-native agentic guidance with 3D-to-2D alignment, which is both technically ambitious and immediately practical for enterprise deployment. Our founder and head of technology have been working on capture workflows for over eight years, scaling to thousands of captures daily across three continents.

Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: Company 17 addresses the emerging challenge that large language models (LLMs) are becoming the new Google. Consumers increasingly discover and evaluate products directly inside systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity, with Shopify integrations and AI-native browsers accelerating a shift toward LLM-driven purchasing. Yet brands have no visibility or control over how they are represented. Outputs are often inaccurate, omit differentiators, or surface competitors — creating reputational, compliance, and revenue risks.\n\nOur solution is the AEO Scorecard™, the first platform for AI Journey Optimization. It evaluates how brands are described across LLMs, detects hallucinations, measures visibility and differentiation, and generates actionable recommendations to improve representation. This includes compliance-aware monitoring for industries like healthcare, life sciences, and financial services, where misinformation can lead to regulatory and safety concerns.\n\nThe global marketing technology sector is valued at over $500B, and regulated industries in particular face urgent needs for visibility and governance in AI-driven discovery. By providing enterprises with transparent, auditable insights and recommendations, Company 17 enables organizations to build trust, visibility, and competitive advantage in the AI-first economy.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: Key Objectives & Success Milestones\nThe objective of this project is to move Company 17 from prototype to a scalable, compliance-ready platform for AI Journey Optimization. Specifically, we aim to:\n\nAutomate brand audits across LLMs by running standardized prompts, capturing outputs, and structuring them into measurable AEO Scores.\n\nDetect and flag hallucinations, omissions, and compliance risks in AI outputs, particularly for regulated industries such as healthcare and finance.\n\nGenerate actionable recommendations (content, schema, or data fixes) through agent-to-agent workflows, enabling brands to actively improve their representation in generative AI.\n\nMilestones (6–12 months):\n\nConvert co-design pilots into first paying customers.\n\nLaunch SaaS platform on GCP with automated scoring dashboards.\n\nIntegrate vector-based retrieval and evaluation pipelines to support compliance monitoring at scale.\n\nImportance\nIf this problem is not solved, enterprises will remain blind to how LLMs are shaping consumer decisions. They risk reputational damage, regulatory non-compliance, and lost revenue as purchasing increasingly shifts into LLM-native platforms. Without Company 17, brands will lack the tools to monitor, measure, or influence the most important discovery channel of the future.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project?

Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: Specific Outputs & Deliverables\nWithin the scope of this project, we expect the following outputs:\n\nProductized AEO Scorecard™ Dashboard – transition from prototype to a scalable, web-based dashboard on GCP that automates prompt testing, scoring, and reporting.\n\nEvaluation & Compliance Pipelines – structured pipelines to detect hallucinations, omissions, and compliance risks in LLM outputs, with benchmarks and audit logs for enterprise adoption.\n\nAction Layer / Recommendation Engine – early-stage agent-to-agent workflow that not only scores outputs but also generates actionable recommendations (e.g., content or schema updates) to improve brand visibility and compliance.\n\nData Infrastructure – scalable storage and retrieval system (e.g., vector-based search) to manage prompt–response datasets and support longitudinal tracking of AI visibility.\n\nHealthcare-Specific MVP – rapid prototyping of a tailored solution through a co-design agreement with a healthcare marketing agency, ensuring our MVP build strategy is validated against the unique compliance and visibility needs of the healthcare sector.\n\nRole of MLAs\nWe expect the MLAs to contribute to pipeline development, orchestration frameworks, and evaluation tooling, while supporting the rapid prototyping workstream with our healthcare partner to ensure sector-specific alignment.\nWho will be the primary users of this solution? Please identify key internal or external user groups (e.g., analysts, customers, clinicians, etc.).: Enterprise Marketing & Communications Leaders – CMOs, VPs of Brand, and digital marketing teams who need visibility into how their organizations are represented in generative AI platforms.  Regulated Industry Stakeholders – Compliance officers and brand managers in healthcare, life sciences, and financial services, where hallucinations or misstatements from LLMs create regulatory, safety, and reputational risks.  Agency Partners – Digital marketing and healthcare-specific agencies who will use Company 17 to deliver AI visibility audits and optimization services to their clients, often as a white-labeled solution.  Internal Analysts & Product Teams – Data and insights teams within enterprises who will use the dashboards and reports to track visibility over time, benchmark competitors, and guide content/SEO strategies adapted for LLMs.\nHow will this solution integrate with your existing operations or product offerings?: New standalone tool or feature\nPlease describe the dataset(s) you intend to use for this project.: What it contains and relevance\nA structured corpus of LLM prompt–response pairs per brand and category. Each record is evaluated against our AEO Scorecard to measure visibility, differentiation, hallucinations, and compliance risk. This dataset is the evidence base for AI Journey Optimization.\n\nSources\na) Programmatic calls to LLM APIs (OpenAI GPT) for standardized prompts\nb) Client-provided public reference materials for grounding (no PII/PHI)\nc) Public product pages and documentation for context checks\n\nCollection method and current format\nExecuted from Replit. Responses are captured as plain text logs and lightweight JSON snippets inside the Replit project workspace. There is no external database yet. We plan to migrate to Google Cloud (e.g., GCS for raw logs and BigQuery/Firestore for structured records) during productization.\n\nKey features or fields\nprompt_id, brand_id, category, model_version, parameters, timestamp, response_text, citations_present, competitor_mentions, missing_differentiators, hallucination_flags, compliance_flags, visibility_score, differentiation_score, sentiment_label, evaluator_id or pipeline_version, run_id.\n\nApproximate size\nCurrent: under 50 MB across pilots since June 2025\nPer engagement: roughly 1,000 to 5,000 records depending on prompt coverage and competitor set\n12-month projection: 1 to 5 GB as pilots expand and longitudinal tracking increases\nWhat is the current state of readiness of this dataset?: Raw/unprocessed\nDoes the dataset contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII): False\nPlease describe how PII is handled or anonymized:: \nHow do you plan to evaluate the model or system’s performance?: At present, evaluation is conducted entirely through human-in-the-loop validation. Each prompt–response record is manually reviewed against the AEO Scorecard to check for hallucinations, competitor mentions, missing differentiators, and compliance risks. This process ensures early pilots generate meaningful insights, but it also highlights limitations: the data can be inconsistent, the model outputs are not fully reliable, and Replit is not a production-grade environment for trusted storage or evaluation.\n\nAs we move from prototype to product, we plan to introduce structured evaluation pipelines to improve consistency and trust. These include building a small golden dataset of validated responses per pilot brand, automated heuristics and business rules (e.g., compliance flags, sentiment checks), and pre/post comparisons to measure the impact of recommended fixes. We also plan to migrate to Google Cloud (BigQuery/Firestore) to support persistent storage, dashboards, and auditable performance tracking.\nHave you already explored or are you considering techniques associated with Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for this use case?

(e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): Yes. There are several important ethical, legal, and societal considerations tied to our use case:\n\nTransparency & Trust: LLMs often generate outputs that are opaque to users. Company 17’s goal is to provide enterprises with transparent, auditable insights into how their brand is being represented, so results can be trusted and verified.\n\nBias & Fairness: Generative models may misrepresent certain products or industries due to training data biases. Our evaluation pipelines are designed to flag omissions, hallucinations, and unfair competitor positioning.\n\nCompliance & Regulation: In healthcare, life sciences, and finance, hallucinations or off-label recommendations could have safety and regulatory consequences. Our solution incorporates compliance checks and is being co-designed with a healthcare-specific marketing agency to align with industry requirements.\n\nData Privacy: We do not process PII or PHI in our workflows. All datasets are limited to public or client-approved content.\n\nSocietal Impact: As LLMs become the “new Google,” lack of oversight could amplify misinformation. Company 17 is designed to mitigate this risk by creating visibility, governance, and accountability.\nHow will you measure success for this project?

    "qa_consolidated": "Project Summary: Describe the key business problem(s) or opportunity this project addresses. Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: North American healthcare faces two urgent problems: provider shortages that delay access to basic care, and medication overload in seniors that drives costly adverse drug events (ADEs). In Canada, nearly 35% of avoidable ER visits could be managed by pharmacists prescribing for minor ailments, while in the U.S., ADEs cause over 600,000 ER visits among older adults each year, costing >$7.5B annually.\n\nCompany 18 operates in digital health and pharmacy technology, serving community pharmacies, pharma companies, and long-term care (LTC) operators. Our platform automates minor ailment prescribing, enabling pharmacists to practice at the top of their scope, save time, and divert patients from ER visits. Early traction includes 14 live pharmacies in British Columbia, with demonstrated ROI.\n\nOur next step is a deprescribing platform for LTC, integrating medication lists, nursing notes, and family input to surface deprescribing opportunities. This addresses regulatory pressure, reduces hospital transfers, and supports a $552M SAM in North American care homes.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: The key objectives of our solution are to automate manual intake and documentation processes, improve clinical decision support for pharmacists, and build a deprescribing platform that integrates families, nurses, and providers in long-term care. By doing so, we enable pharmacists to practice at the top of their scope, reduce avoidable ER visits, and improve patient safety.\n\nSuccess milestones include:\n\nScaling our minor ailment automation from 14 to 50+ pharmacies within 12 months.\n\nLaunching and validating deprescribing pilots in 2–3 LTC chains, proving time savings, regulatory compliance, and reduced hospital transfers.\n\nEstablishing pharma and payor partnerships to expand impact across the healthcare system.\n\nIf this problem is not solved, patients will continue to flood ERs for basic conditions, costing billions in avoidable spending, while seniors in LTC remain vulnerable to medication overload, leading to unnecessary hospitalizations and family distress. Delaying implementation means perpetuating inefficiency, regulatory risk for operators, and missed opportunities to empower pharmacists as front-line providers.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool. Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: For this project, we envision a set of deliverables that demonstrate how AI can streamline deprescribing and pharmacist workflows in long-term care:\n\nFunctional prototype of a deprescribing platform that integrates with sample EHR/medication data, showcasing how resident medication lists can be ingested and processed.\n\nAI-powered decision support module that extracts key insights from nursing reports and family input, then generates deprescribing opportunities for pharmacists.\n\nDual-facing dashboards: one for care staff/pharmacists to view flagged risks and recommendations, and one for families to contribute observations.\n\nAPIs and backend pipelines that support secure data ingestion (medication lists, text inputs) and structured outputs for the pharmacist-facing interface.\n\nDocumentation and hand-off package describing the architecture, data pipeline, and model selection so it can be integrated into Company 18’s broader platform.\n\nWe expect the MLAs to deliver a working proof-of-concept demonstrating this workflow end-to-end, with clear metrics on feasibility and usability that we can build on for pilot deployment in care homes.\nWho will be the primary users of this solution? Please identify key internal or external user groups (e.g., analysts, customers, clinicians, etc.).: The primary users of this solution are:  Pharmacists (external): receive structured deprescribing recommendations, supported by nursing/family input, to improve medication safety and reduce review time.  Nurses and care staff in long-term care homes (external): enter shift reports and observations into the platform, ensuring frontline insights are captured.  Family caregivers (external): provide feedback on resident behavior or side effects, increasing transparency and engagement in care decisions.  Care home administrators (external): access compliance-ready reports that demonstrate proactive medication management and reduce regulatory risk.  Company 18 internal team (internal): product, engineering, and analytics teams who will monitor performance, refine models, and support integration with partner facilities.  Together, these groups ensure the platform drives value across the care ecosystem: safer prescribing for residents, efficiency for providers, and trust for families and regulators.\nHow will this solution integrate with your existing operations or product offerings?: Enhancement to an existing system\nPlease describe the dataset(s) you intend to use for this project.: Content & Relevance:\nThe dataset will include resident medication lists, nursing shift notes, and family caregiver observations from long-term care (LTC) settings. This information is directly relevant to deprescribing, as it captures polypharmacy profiles, side-effect observations, and care staff input that inform pharmacist decision-making.\n\nSources:\n\nMedication lists from LTC electronic health record (EHR) systems (e.g., PointClickCare).\n\nNursing/care staff reports entered during shifts.\n\nFamily-generated input via patient-facing portals.\n\nSupplementary synthetic datasets (publicly available deprescribing trials, MedSafer, Deprescribing.org guidelines) for training and validation.\n\nCollection & Format:\n\nMedication data: structured, tabular (drug name, dose, frequency, start/end date).\n\nNursing and family reports: unstructured text (symptom notes, side-effect reports).\n\nIntegrated into CSV/JSON files for ingestion.\n\nKey Features/Fields:\n\nResident demographics (age, sex, diagnoses).\n\nActive medications (drug, class, indication, dose, frequency).\n\nAdverse event markers (falls, confusion, sedation, appetite change).\n\nFree-text nursing and caregiver observations.\n\nOutcome labels (e.g., ER visit, hospitalization, deprescribed medication).\n\nSize:\n\nInitial pilot dataset: ~500–1,000 resident profiles across 2–3 LTC homes.\n\nEach resident profile: ~10–15 active meds, multiple nursing/family notes per week.\n\nApprox. 50,000–100,000 medication records and 10,000+ text notes over a 6–12 month range.\nWhat is the current state of readiness of this dataset?: Raw/unprocessed\nDoes the dataset contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII): False\nPlease describe how PII is handled or anonymized:: \nHow do you plan to evaluate the model or system’s performance?: We plan to evaluate the system’s performance using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods tailored to healthcare AI:\n\nHuman-in-the-loop validation: Pharmacists will review deprescribing recommendations generated by the system. Acceptance rates, modifications, and rejections will provide a direct measure of clinical relevance and safety.\n\nGolden dataset/benchmarking: We will test against curated datasets from published deprescribing trials and guidelines (e.g., MedSafer, Deprescribing.org algorithms) to benchmark system accuracy in identifying potentially inappropriate medications.\n\nHeuristics & business rules: Built-in rule checks (e.g., Beers Criteria, drug–drug interaction lists) will validate that high-risk medications are consistently flagged.\n\nPre/post comparisons: We will measure time required for comprehensive medication reviews before vs. after tool use, number of medications deprescribed per review, and changes in avoidable ER transfer rates in pilot sites.\n\nMetrics dashboards: Dashboards will track usage (active users, number of med reviews), performance (recommendations generated vs. accepted), and outcomes (admissions avoided, compliance reports generated).\n\nQualitative feedback: Surveys and interviews with pharmacists, nurses, and families will capture usability, trust, and satisfaction, ensuring the platform is not only accurate but also adopted in practice.\n\nThis blended evaluation strategy ensures both clinical safety and operational impact are validated before scaling.\nHave you already explored or are you considering techniques associated with Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for this use case? If so, please specify which specific models or approaches used or are under consideration.: No\nAre there any ethical, legal, or societal considerations related to the use of Generative AI or autonomous agents in this context? (e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): Yes - deploying Generative AI in healthcare requires addressing several ethical, legal, and societal considerations:\n\nData privacy & security: Patient data must be protected under HIPAA/PHIPA. All datasets used for training or inference will be de-identified, encrypted, and access-controlled to prevent misuse.\n\nTransparency & user trust: AI outputs (e.g., deprescribing suggestions or patient summaries) will be clearly labeled as recommendations, with pharmacists retaining final clinical judgment. This avoids over-reliance on autonomous agents.\n\nFairness & bias: Older adults in long-term care are a vulnerable population. We will evaluate models to ensure recommendations are not biased against certain demographic groups (e.g., women, ethnic minorities) and are consistent with evidence-based guidelines.\n\nClinical safety: All generative outputs are human-in-the-loop — pharmacists validate recommendations before any action is taken. This ensures that the system augments, not replaces, professional expertise.\n\nRegulatory compliance: We will align with emerging standards for AI in healthcare (FDA guidance in the U.S., Health Canada digital health frameworks) and document model behavior for auditability.\n\nSocietal impact: By improving deprescribing, we aim to reduce unnecessary hospitalizations and build trust with families by increasing transparency in care decisions. However, safeguards will be in place to ensure families understand the system is an aid, not an autonomous decision-maker.\n\nThese considerations are central to our design philosophy, ensuring that AI enhances patient safety, empowers clinicians, and builds confidence among families and regulators.\nHow will you measure success for this project? Please include any baseline metrics, KPIs, or qualitative outcomes you hope to observe.: We will measure success through a mix of baseline metrics, quantitative KPIs, and qualitative feedback:\n\nBaseline metrics:\n\nAverage time spent by pharmacists on a comprehensive medication review.\n\nCurrent rate of deprescribing interventions in long-term care homes.\n\nFrequency of ER transfers related to adverse drug events.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nEfficiency: ≥30% reduction in time required for pharmacist-led medication reviews.\n\nClinical impact: ≥20% increase in identification of deprescribing opportunities compared to baseline.\n\nAdoption: % of nursing staff and family members actively contributing observations through the platform (target ≥60%).\n\nDecision support accuracy: Proportion of AI-generated suggestions accepted or partially accepted by pharmacists (target ≥70%).\n\nQualitative outcomes:\n\nImproved confidence and trust among families, as measured through caregiver satisfaction surveys.\n\nPositive usability feedback from nurses and pharmacists (ease of integration into workflow).\n\nDemonstrated value to care home administrators through compliance-ready reports and reduced regulatory risk.\n\nSuccess will be defined by showing that the platform not only augments pharmacist efficiency but also leads to safer prescribing decisions, higher stakeholder engagement, and evidence of reduced avoidable hospital transfers.\nWhat infrastructure or platforms do you plan to use to support the development of this project?: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Vector-provided infrastructure (if applicable), Not yet determined\nIn one or two sentences, describe the ideal MLA candidate for this project.: The ideal candidate for this project would have experience with LLMs and NLP (summarization, extraction, clinical text processing), strong skills in data cleaning and pipeline engineering, and familiarity with healthcare or clinical datasets. They should be comfortable with human-in-the-loop AI design, ensuring outputs are accurate, interpretable, and aligned with pharmacist decision support workflows.\nPlease describe your technical team (if any). Include the number of staff and relevant roles (e.g., ML engineers, data analysts, product managers, etc.).: We have a CTO and Software engineer.

    "qa_consolidated": "Project Summary: Describe the key business problem(s) or opportunity this project addresses. Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: Luxury is a 1.5 trillion dollar global industry where brand equity is the most valuable and fragile asset. Yet luxury brands spend an average of 4.8 million dollars annually on AI, and 73 percent report damage to brand perception from misaligned tools. No standards currently exist to determine whether AI systems are luxury ready, leaving adoption both risky and urgent.\n\nAI Company 19 solves this problem by building the intelligence infrastructure luxury brands will rely on to adopt AI safely. Our proprietary scoring system applies IQ test principles to evaluate how well AI tools think at the luxury level. Separate frameworks for Emerging and Established brands provide precise insights, while certification ensures tools meet strict equity preserving standards.\n\nOur target audience is global luxury houses such as LVMH, Kering, and Richemont, as well as emerging luxury brands and AI developers seeking access to the luxury market. Market forces including the EU AI Act, competitive pressure from early adopters, and rising demand for personalization among ultra high net worth clients create immediate urgency.\n\nThis project establishes Company 19 as the decision layer for luxury AI adoption, enabling risk controlled deployment and shaping how AI is built for the world’s most valuable brands.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: Our primary objective is to automate a currently manual evaluation process and build the SaaS platform that becomes the intelligence layer for luxury AI adoption. Success will be measured by:\n\nAutomation of evaluations: Transition from manual scoring to an automated pipeline capable of scaling assessments from hundreds to thousands of tools.\n\nCertification launch: Operationalize Company 19 Scores as the entry standard for AI developers seeking luxury market access.\n\nAlliance: Formalize an invite only Alliance of luxury brands and developers to maintain standards and accelerate adoption.\n\nMarketplace: Launch the certified Marketplace that connects brands with AI tools proven luxury ready.\n\nWithout this project, luxury brands face unmanaged AI adoption, leaving brand equity worth 1.5 trillion dollars globally at risk. Misaligned AI can dilute exclusivity, damage heritage, and erode trust among ultra high net worth clients.\n\nDelay would also weaken competitive positioning. Conglomerates are already adopting AI, regulatory compliance under the EU AI Act is becoming mandatory, and developers need certification pathways. If Company 19 is not implemented now, luxury brands will either adopt unsafe tools or delay innovation, both outcomes undermining long term competitiveness and consumer trust.\n\nThis project ensures that luxury AI adoption is safe, standardized, and scalable, safeguarding brand equity while enabling growth.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool. Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: We expect the MLAs to help us build the foundation of our automated evaluation system.

This will demonstrate technical feasibility, reduce manual load, and create the base infrastructure for our SaaS platform.\nBy the end of the program, success means we can automatically process and score a set of AI tools in at least one category, with results displayed in a dashboard that can be expanded into our certification marketplace.\nWho will be the primary users of this solution? Please identify key internal or external user groups (e.g., analysts, customers, clinicians, etc.).: The primary external users of this solution are: Established luxury houses (e.g., LVMH, Kering, Richemont) adopting AI but requiring validated, heritage preserving tools.   Emerging luxury brands seeking scalable credibility and risk controlled AI adoption.   AI developers who need certification to access the luxury market and prove compliance with brand equity standards.   Key internal users include: Company 19 analysts who run evaluations and generate Company 19 Scores.   Alliance members (luxury executives, academics, and developers) who review insights and guide standard setting.   Together, these groups form the ecosystem that ensures evaluations are credible, certifications are trusted, and the SaaS platform delivers actionable intelligence for adoption.\nHow will this solution integrate with your existing operations or product offerings?: New standalone tool or feature\nPlease describe the dataset(s) you intend to use for this project.: Dataset Description\n\nContents and Relevance\nOur dataset contains 132 comprehensive AI tool evaluations across 10 luxury categories (copy generation, image creation, personalization, etc.). Each evaluation includes Company 19 Scores (0–1000), parameter-level ratings, compliance assessments, and cross-tool comparisons. This dataset directly enables automated scoring algorithms and pattern recognition for luxury-appropriate AI outputs.\n\n\nSources\nData is generated internally through systematic AI tool testing using our proprietary methodology. Sources include direct API interactions, structured prompt testing, and brand alignment tests across defined luxury scenarios.\n\n\nCollection Method and Format\nEvaluations are conducted using controlled luxury brand scenarios and stored securely in Notion as the source of truth. From there, structured data is selectively synced into Webflow, where only visualized scores are displayed. This ensures public transparency while keeping our scoring methodology protected as a trade secret. Formats include structured tabular data with JSON metadata for complex evaluations.\n\n\nKey Features\n\n\nTool identification and category classification\n\n\nCompany 19 Scores by parameter (brand voice precision, UHNW segmentation, heritage preservation)\n\n\nEmerging vs Established brand performance differentials\n\n\nOutput samples with quality ratings\n\n\nCompliance indicators for luxury standards\n\n\nTemporal data showing tool evolution\n\n\nSize\n132 evaluations spanning 18 months of testing. 500 MB of structured data, including scoring matrices, output samples, and metadata. Targeting 250+ evaluations within 6 months to expand pattern recognition.\nWhat is the current state of readiness of this dataset?: Partially annotated\nDoes the dataset contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII): False\nPlease describe how PII is handled or anonymized:: \nHow do you plan to evaluate the model or system’s performance?: We will evaluate performance using a combination of benchmark datasets, human validation, and dashboard tracking:\nGolden dataset: Use our existing library of 132 evaluations across 10 luxury categories as a controlled benchmark set. Each tool has parameter-level scores and outputs for cross-comparison.\n\n\nHuman in the loop: Luxury analysts review automated outputs to validate alignment with brand tone, exclusivity, and heritage preservation. This ensures subjective qualities are captured with accuracy.\n\n\nBusiness rules and heuristics: Scoring thresholds (e.g., 900+ Company 19 Score required for certification) function as clear success indicators.\n\n\nPre and post comparisons: Track improvements in evaluation accuracy as we transition from manual to automated pipelines.\n\n\nDashboards and metrics: Internal dashboards will monitor scoring consistency, variance across categories, and time-to-completion metrics to measure efficiency gains.\n\n\nSuccess will be defined by achieving consistent alignment between automated scores and analyst reviews, reduced variance in scoring outputs, and demonstrable scalability beyond manual capacity.\nHave you already explored or are you considering techniques associated with Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for this use case? If so, please specify which specific models or approaches used or are under consideration.: Yes. We actively explore Generative AI and LLMs as part of our evaluation process. Our work includes systematic testing of models such as OpenAI GPT-4/4o, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and open-source LLMs fine-tuned for enterprise contexts. We also assess multi-modal models like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Runway for image and video generation.\n\nOur current approach focuses on prompt engineering, controlled scenario testing, and comparative scoring to measure how these models perform in luxury-specific contexts such as brand voice precision, ultra-high-net-worth segmentation, cultural nuance, and exclusivity preservation.\n\nFor future development, we are considering building automated scoring pipelines using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), supervised classification, and explainability layers to benchmark LLM outputs against luxury standards.\nAre there any ethical, legal, or societal considerations related to the use of Generative AI or autonomous agents in this context? (e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): Yes. In luxury contexts, the risks are amplified because brand equity is fragile and consumer trust is paramount. Generative AI outputs often carry bias, cultural insensitivity, and lack of transparency that can damage heritage, alienate high-value clients, or misrepresent exclusivity. Legal considerations include compliance with the EU AI Act, which requires independent evaluation of high-risk systems. Ethical concerns focus on ensuring that AI-driven personalization does not compromise fairness or privacy for ultra-high-net-worth individuals, whose expectations for discretion are non-negotiable.\n\nOur methodology addresses these issues by introducing a third-party standard of evaluation that enforces accountability, transparency, and explainability before AI tools are deployed in luxury environments.

    "qa_consolidated": "Project Summary: Describe the key business problem(s) or opportunity this project addresses. Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: Company 20 operates in the innovation funding and government grants sector, where Canadian SMEs struggle to access the billions of dollars available each year through federal and provincial programs. The key business problem is that the process of identifying programs, preparing applications, and managing claims is highly fragmented, slow, and costly. Innovators spend scarce time navigating administrative complexity rather than building their businesses, while governments struggle with oversight and under-deployment of allocated funds\n\nOur target audience includes Canadian SMEs in technology, manufacturing, and life sciences — companies that are innovation-driven but resource-constrained. These firms rely on timely non-dilutive funding to scale, yet lack the internal expertise to keep pace with changing program requirements and compliance obligations.\n\nThe market context is large and highly regulated: Canada allocates more than $5 billion annually in innovation-related grants and incentives, but much of this remains underutilized or delayed. At the same time, regulatory pressures are rising around data sovereignty and privacy (PIPEDA), and governments are seeking more efficient, accountable mechanisms for fund distribution.\n\nThe opportunity is for Company 20 to deliver an AI-powered funding operating system: a platform that reduces application preparation time from weeks to hours, automates compliance and claims, and creates a transparent, data-rich infrastructure for funders and applicants alike. By addressing inefficiency at both the applicant and government levels, Company 20 can unlock significant economic value and position Canada as a leader in AI-enabled innovation funding.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: [Objectives and Success Milestones]\nThe proposed solution aims to accelerate and improve the accuracy of grant preparation and compliance by creating a hybrid AI system that combines the efficiency of large language models with the precision of symbolic reasoning methods.\n[Key objectives:]\n•\tAutomate document-heavy workflows: Ingest and process client reports, spreadsheets, emails, and meeting transcripts to automatically generate structured company profiles and draft applications.\n•\tImprove decision support with knowledge graphs: Build a RAG system organized by handcrafted semantic hierarchies, enabling consistent retrieval and contextualization of program and company information.\n•\tDevelop a hybrid neurosymbolic architecture: Innovate on how symbolic reasoning modules (for temporal, financial, and logical inference) are integrated with adapted LLM components (improved embeddings and retrieval pipelines) so that each reinforces the other.\n•\tAdvance hierarchical organization methods: Explore probabilistic clustering approaches (e.g., Gaussian mixture–based) to improve the structuring of knowledge graphs, enabling better scalability and precision.\n•\tStreamline compliance and oversight: Automate expense categorization, compliance validation, and reporting to reduce costs for both applicants and funders.\nMilestones:\n•\tNear-term (6–12 months): Deploy baseline KG-RAG prototype with handcrafted semantic hierarchy; demonstrate reduction of application preparation time from a week to a day.\n•\tMid-term (12–15 months): Deliver a hybrid symbolic–neural RAG prototype integrating symbolic inference with enhanced embedding and retrieval models; demonstrate measurable accuracy and reasoning improvements, along with improved methods for hierarchical organization.\n•\tLong-term (3+ years): Deploy a unified, production-grade platform capable of serving 500+ SMEs annually, managing $500M+ in applications, and achieving a 70%+ success rate.\n[Importance:]\nIf this project is delayed, Canadian SMEs will continue to face costly, slow, and error-prone access to funding, and governments will continue to suffer from inefficient fund deployment and oversight. Timely implementation establishes Company 20 as a leader in responsible AI for funding infrastructure and ensures Canada builds competitive advantage in hybrid neurosymbolic approaches to applied AI.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool. Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: The project will generate concrete tools that support both our internal consultants and our longer-term R&D program. The expected deliverables within the MLA cohort include:\n•\tFunctional prototype of a knowledge-graph-based RAG system with our handcrafted semantic hierarchy implemented in the knowledge graph construction process.\n•\tInternal backend system and pipeline for ingesting diverse document types (reports, spreadsheets, PDFs, emails, transcripts) into Postgres + Neo4j, ensuring compliance with PIPEDA and Canadian data sovereignty requirements.\n•\tAPIs for integration with Company 20’s workflow tools to allow dynamic retrieval of client knowledge for grant application preparation.\n•\tResearch-facing interface (internal only) built on OpenWebUI, supporting consultants and collaborators in testing retrieval results and knowledge graph performance.\n•\tEvaluation reports and benchmarks measuring performance gains over traditional RAG (speed, accuracy, and consistency), forming the foundation for mid-term neurosymbolic enhancements.\nThe MLAs will be expected to help design and implement the prototype KG-RAG system and ingestion pipeline, ensure APIs are functional for workflow integration, and support benchmarking experiments that validate the system’s effectiveness.\nWho will be the primary users of this solution? Please identify key internal or external user groups (e.g., analysts, customers, clinicians, etc.).: In the near term, the primary users will be Company 20’s internal consultants and grant writers, who rely on the system to streamline document intake, application drafting, and claims management. For them, the platform directly reduces preparation time and improves accuracy, enabling higher throughput and better outcomes for clients.  A second internal group of users will be research collaborators and student interns, who will interact with the research-facing interface to test and refine knowledge graph construction, neurosymbolic RAG methods, and evaluation benchmarks.  Strategically, the solution is also intended to serve government funding agencies as a future user group. By adapting the same infrastructure for the funder side, agencies could automate compliance checks, streamline oversight, and improve transparency across billions in annual funding. This dual-sided relevance — supporting both applicants and agencies — amplifies the system’s long-term value and positions it as a national infrastructure opportunity.\nHow will this solution integrate with your existing operations or product offerings?: Enhancement to an existing system\nPlease describe the dataset(s) you intend to use for this project.: 1. Contents and Relevance:\nThe dataset consists of company documentation and communications directly relevant to preparing and submitting grant applications. It includes financial reports, spreadsheets, tax filings, technical reports, funding documents, meeting transcripts, and email correspondence. This information is essential because grant preparation requires synthesizing details from diverse and often incomplete sources into a coherent, compliant application.\n\n2. Sources:\n- Internal company documents provided by clients (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, PDF, Google Docs).\n- Client communications via email threads (Google Workspace / Gmail).\n- Meeting transcripts (captured through the Fathom API.)\n- Supplemental materials obtained via web scraping (e.g., public program information).\n\n3. Collection and Format:\nData is provided directly by clients through secure uploads, by integration with Google Workspace APIs, or via API-based services (Fathom). The data is currently unstructured, stored as raw documents, text transcripts, and email threads.\n\n4. Key Features / Fields:\n- Company identifiers (name, sector, size, location).\n- Financial data (revenue, expenses, balance sheets).\n- Project descriptions and technical details.\n- Program requirements and deadlines.\n- Communication records (meeting notes, email Q&A with clients).\n\n5. Approximate Size:\nCurrently ~800 MB of unstructured data, covering ~150 client companies, and growing rapidly as new clients onboard. We anticipate significant growth in both volume and diversity of documents as the platform scales.\nWhat is the current state of readiness of this dataset?: Raw/unprocessed\nDoes the dataset contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII): True\nPlease describe how PII is handled or anonymized:: PII is handled under PIPEDA compliance, with all data stored on Canadian servers and accessed only via Google Workspace authentication. For anonymization, we apply a combination of:\n•\tRedaction of direct identifiers (names, emails, phone numbers, addresses).\n•\tPseudonymization (replacing entities with consistent placeholders to preserve context).\n•\tSelective removal of sensitive fields in structured documents (e.g., tax ID numbers).\n•\tUse of synthetic or masked data when sharing datasets externally (e.g., with students or collaborators).\nThis ensures that client-identifying information is stripped out or substituted before data is used outside controlled Company 20 operations\nHow do you plan to evaluate the model or system’s performance?: While internal anonymized datasets will be used for system development and compliance testing, public benchmark datasets will be required for research evaluation and publication. These provide a common ground for measuring progress and ensuring results are generalizable beyond our client base.\nWe will pursue a dual evaluation strategy:\n1.\tInternal Evaluation (Use-Case Driven):\nThe system will be applied directly to Company 20’s workflows (grant application preparation, compliance checks) to confirm that it meets our operational needs. We will measure attributes of user experience (e.g., speed, usability, accuracy) and collect user stories from our consultants. This ensures the tool is valuable in practice, but we acknowledge that this is not a systematic research evaluation.\n2.\tExternal Evaluation (Research Benchmarks):\nFor systematic and publishable evaluation, we will rely on public datasets, such as MSRS (Phanse et al., 2025, arXiv:2508.20867). These benchmarks provide structured, multi-source reasoning tasks that allow us to measure performance improvements in knowledge-graph-based RAG and neurosymbolic methods in a way that is comparable to academic baselines.\nThis combination ensures our solution is both practically validated for our use case and rigorously benchmarked for the research community.\nHave you already explored or are you considering techniques associated with Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for this use case? If so, please specify which specific models or approaches used or are under consideration.: Yes. Our consultants currently make active use of Generative AI and LLMs in day-to-day work. This includes:\n•\tGoogle AI Studio (Gemini 2.5 Pro) for drafting and refining grant-related text. Some assistance from GPT 5-based models.\n•\tOpenWebUI connected to multiple open-source and commercial models via OpenRouter, giving access to a wide range of LLMs for experimentation. Our consultants experimented with a variety of models, such as LLaMA 3 (Meta), Command R+ (Cohere), and Mistral09x22B (Mistral AI). \nFor this project, we are considering approaches that combine these existing LLM tools with knowledge-graph-based RAG and ultimately a neurosymbolic hybrid architecture that integrates symbolic reasoning (temporal, financial, logical) with improved LLM embeddings and retrieval methods.\nAre there any ethical, legal, or societal considerations related to the use of Generative AI or autonomous agents in this context? (e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): Yes. Several considerations are relevant:\n•\tData privacy and sovereignty: All client data must be handled under PIPEDA and stored on Canadian servers to maintain compliance and trust.\n•\tTransparency and user trust: Our consultants need clear visibility into how outputs are generated, especially in high-stakes contexts like financial reasoning and eligibility criteria. We aim to avoid “black box” outputs by integrating symbolic reasoning alongside LLMs.\n•\tAccuracy and reliability: Errors or hallucinations in generated text could directly affect funding outcomes. We mitigate this risk by keeping humans in the loop: consultants always verify completions before use and review final applications with clients. In parallel, we aim to reduce errors by incorporating symbolic methods and external verification (e.g., spreadsheets, logic engines).\n•\tFairness and bias: While secondary to privacy, we remain attentive to bias, particularly since many LLMs are trained on corpora dominated by non-Canadian content. In the future, we may explore fine-tuning open-source models on Canadian data to mitigate this risk.\nOur design philosophy emphasizes privacy first, compliance by default, and explainability through neurosymbolic methods, ensuring that ethical and legal standards are integral to the system.\nHow will you measure success for this project? Please include any baseline metrics, KPIs, or qualitative outcomes you hope to observe.: We will measure success across three dimensions: efficiency, accuracy, and usability.\n•\tBaseline Metrics:\no\tCurrent application preparation time: ~1 week per grant.\no\tCurrent dataset size: ~800 MB across ~150 clients, growing.\no\tCurrent success rate: ~20% of submitted applications.\n•\tTarget KPIs:\no\tEfficiency: Reduce grant preparation time from 1 week → 1 day (near-term) and toward 1 hour (long-term).\no\tAccuracy: Lower the rate of factual/financial errors in draft applications by ≥50% compared to current LLM-only baselines.\no\tUsability: Positive consultant feedback (≥80% report the tool makes their work faster/easier); collection of internal user stories validating fit-for-purpose.\n•\tResearch Outcomes:\no\tDemonstrate that our baseline knowledge-graph RAG improves retrieval precision/recall compared to vanilla RAG.\no\tShow that mid-term neurosymbolic hybrid RAG further improves reasoning accuracy on tasks such as temporal alignment and financial calculations.\no\tBenchmark results against public datasets (e.g., MSRS, Phanse et al. 2025) to provide systematic, publishable evaluation.\nSuccess will be defined as meeting near-term KPIs while also producing validated research evidence that our approach advances the state of RAG for real-world applications\nWhat infrastructure or platforms do you plan to use to support the development of this project?: Internal on-premise or virtual private servers, Open-source or public tools (e.g., Colab, Hugging Face, Weights & Biases)\nIn one or two sentences, describe the ideal MLA candidate for this project.: The ideal MLA candidate has a strong foundation in NLP and Python, with familiarity in knowledge-graph-based RAG methods. Background in classical AI and symbolic reasoning (e.g., logical systems, temporal reasoning, planning algorithms) is highly valuable, as it enables them to contribute to our neurosymbolic approach that combines retrieval, reasoning, and LLMs\nPlease describe your technical team (if any). Include the number of staff and relevant roles (e.g., ML engineers, data analysts, product managers, etc.).: The current team consists of:\n\n-  (CTO): Software developer with 15 years of applied R&D experience in computer vision and robotics for industrial automation. MSc in Computer Science (ABD status for PhD), specialized in computer vision and robot control (planning and execution). Inventor on 6 patents, with extensive experience bridging applied research and industrial deployment.\n\n-  (CEO): Scientist and entrepreneur with a PhD in Chemical Biology, 11 peer-reviewed publications, and founder of GreenLid, a CleanTech startup with a successful exit. Brings deep expertise in commercialization, innovation funding, and client engagement, providing strategic oversight and business leadership.\n\nOver the next year, we plan to expand the technical team with three roles: backend engineer, frontend engineer, and devops engineer. In parallel, we expect to involve student interns and academic collaborators in research prototypes focused on knowledge-graph-based RAG and neurosymbolic reasoning.\nIs there any additional context or background information you would like to provide to help us evaluate your use case application?: Company 20 is uniquely positioned to both deliver immediate impact and contribute to cutting-edge AI research. In the near term, our solution accelerates access to non-dilutive funding for Canadian SMEs by making grant preparation faster, cheaper, and more reliable. In the longer term, our neurosymbolic approach to RAG represents a novel contribution to AI research with applications beyond our sector.\n\nOur team combines technical depth (15+ years of applied R&D, 6 patents) with entrepreneurial and commercialization expertise (PhD, successful CleanTech exit). This balance ensures both feasibility and scalability.\n\nWe see strong alignment with Vector’s mission: our work supports Canadian data sovereignty and PIPEDA compliance, advances responsible AI methods, and strengthens Canada’s innovation funding infrastructure.

    "qa_consolidated": "Project Summary: Describe the key business problem(s) or opportunity this project addresses. Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: Problem/Opportunity:\n\nAgriculture, one of the world’s largest and most vital industries, faces increasing pressure to adapt to climate change, regulatory demands, and market volatility. Traditional farming practices often lead to inefficient resource use, over-fertilization, high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and poor environmental outcomes. Moreover, farmers struggle to optimize crop yields while reducing costs and complying with environmental regulations. This project aims to solve these challenges by using advanced agritech solutions to collect real-time data and create predictive financial models that enhance farm profitability, sustainability, and compliance.\n\nKey Business Opportunity:\n\nThe project leverages soil sensor data and GHG emissions data to forecast commodity prices and optimize farm operations. By accurately predicting future market trends, crop yields, and carbon credit opportunities, farmers can make more informed decisions about fertilizer use, irrigation, livestock management, and emissions reduction strategies. The result is a win-win: reducing environmental impact while enhancing farm profitability through smarter, data-driven practices.\n\nTarget Audience:\n\nFarmers (particularly those in crops, dairy, and livestock sectors) who are looking to improve yield, reduce input costs, and enhance sustainability.\n\nAgribusinesses and agritech companies interested in adopting new technologies to drive growth and optimize farm management.\n\nRegulators seeking tools to ensure sustainability and compliance with environmental standards, such as GHG emissions limits and water quality control.\n\nCarbon Markets that can utilize the data for carbon credit trading and verifying emissions reductions from agricultural activities.\n\nRelevant Market Context:\n\nIndustry: The global agricultural technology (agritech) market is projected to reach $42.5 billion by 2027, driven by technological advancements in sensors, machine learning, and climate-smart farming solutions. The precision agriculture segment, in particular, is experiencing rapid growth as farmers seek efficient, cost-effective solutions for improving yields and reducing resource consumption.\n\nSize of the Market:\n\nGlobal agricultural market is worth over $3.3 trillion (2019), with farming accounting for a significant portion of this.\n\nThe carbon market (where emissions reductions translate into tradable carbon credits) is expected to grow substantially, reaching an estimated $100 billion by 2030.\n\nThe precision agriculture market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.8% between 2020 and 2027, fueled by increased adoption of IoT sensors and AI-powered analytics.\n\nRegulatory Environment:\n\nGovernments are tightening emissions regulations for agriculture, with more stringent limits on GHG emissions (e.g., methane and nitrous oxide from livestock and soil).\n\nThere is increasing emphasis on sustainable farming practices and carbon sequestration, with many countries offering financial incentives for farms that reduce their environmental footprint and participate in carbon credit programs.\n\nEnvironmental regulations are becoming more complex, creating a need for solutions that help farms stay compliant while maintaining profitability.\n\nBusiness Context:\n\nFarming Practices: Traditional farming still relies heavily on trial-and-error and seasonal practices. This project moves away from guesswork to data-driven decisions, using real-time data to model future scenarios.\n\nMarket Volatility: The commodities market is volatile, with crop prices fluctuating due to climate events, trade policies, and changing consumer preferences. Predicting commodity prices with high accuracy will give farmers a competitive edge in pricing and market entry.\n\nCarbon Credits & Sustainability: Increasing pressure to meet climate goals and mitigate carbon emissions opens up new revenue opportunities for farmers who adopt sustainable farming practices. Participating in carbon markets by reducing emissions could provide an additional stream of income.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: 1. Key Objective: Automate Data Collection and Analysis\n\nDescription: The first objective is to automate the real-time collection of critical agricultural data, including soil quality, water nutrients, GHG emissions from livestock, and environmental conditions. The data will be captured through IoT sensors and integrated into a unified platform for seamless monitoring and analysis.\n\nSuccess Milestone: Successfully deploy and integrate a network of IoT sensors across pilot farms, with real-time data flowing into an analytics platform. Achieve a 90%+ data accuracy rate in capturing soil nutrient levels, water quality, GHG emissions, and environmental conditions.\n\nImportance:\n\nWithout automation, farmers must rely on manual processes for collecting soil, emissions, and climate data, which is time-consuming, inaccurate, and costly.\n\nManual data collection creates significant barriers to understanding the full scope of farm operations, leading to inefficiencies, potential regulatory non-compliance, and missed opportunities for profitability.\n\n2. Key Objective: Develop Predictive Financial and Yield Forecasting Models\n\nDescription: The project will leverage the data collected to develop advanced predictive financial models that forecast crop yields, commodity prices, input optimization (fertilizer, feed, water), and emissions reductions. These models will also include risk forecasting for climate events (droughts, floods), market volatility, and carbon credit calculations for farms looking to monetize emissions reductions.\n\nSuccess Milestone: Develop and deploy a working prototype of the predictive financial model, including at least three key metrics—crop yield forecasts, carbon credit eligibility, and input optimization strategies—that can be used to simulate scenarios and make actionable farm decisions.\n\nImportance:\n\nIf predictive models are not developed, farmers will continue to make decisions based on intuition rather than accurate forecasts, leading to over-fertilization, missed opportunities for carbon credits, and suboptimal pricing of crops in volatile markets.\n\nLack of forecasting tools hinders the ability to identify growth opportunities, resulting in missed cost-saving and revenue-generating possibilities, which may undermine long-term profitability.\n\n3. Key Objective: Improve Decision Support for Sustainability and Compliance\n\nDescription: Build a comprehensive decision support system (DSS) that integrates the data and predictive models into actionable insights, helping farmers make data-driven decisions about resource use, emissions reductions, sustainability practices, and compliance with environmental regulations (e.g., GHG emission limits, water quality standards).\n\nSuccess Milestone: Deliver a functional user dashboard with real-time insights on farm performance, including resource consumption, environmental impact, and regulatory compliance. Achieve user satisfaction ratings of at least 85% for ease of use and effectiveness in decision-making.\n\nImportance:\n\nWithout a decision support system, farmers will struggle to comply with rapidly evolving environmental regulations, leading to potential penalties or fines. Additionally, they risk falling behind in adopting sustainability practices that are becoming crucial for market access and brand reputation.\n\nA lack of decision support could also mean missing out on carbon credit trading or other sustainability-related financial incentives that can help offset farming costs.\n\n4. Key Objective: Enable Real-Time Monitoring of Financial Performance and Carbon Credits\n\nDescription: Create a module within the platform for farmers to monitor their financial performance (e.g., cost savings on inputs, increased crop yield) alongside carbon credit performance (GHG reductions and carbon credit eligibility). This will allow farmers to track their environmental and financial progress in one unified system.\n\nSuccess Milestone: The platform should enable farmers to track at least two key financial indicators (e.g., fertilizer cost savings, carbon credit revenue) in real time, with automated calculations for carbon credit eligibility and potential revenue.\n\nImportance:\n\nIf the financial and carbon credit monitoring feature is delayed or not implemented, farmers will be unable to quantify the return on investment (ROI) of their sustainable practices. This would undermine efforts to optimize farm operations and capitalize on carbon credit opportunities, which are increasingly important revenue streams.\n\nThe inability to track financial performance and carbon credits may reduce farmers' willingness to invest in climate-smart technologies due to a lack of clear value propositions.\n\n5. Key Objective: Develop Scalable Technology for Widespread Adoption\n\nDescription: Ensure that the solution is scalable across different farm sizes, climates, and crop types. The platform and sensor technology should be adaptable to various use cases and should include easy-to-deploy options for small, medium, and large farms.\n\nSuccess Milestone: Achieve a successful pilot test of the solution on farms of varying sizes and types (e.g., crop-focused, livestock-focused, mixed operations) with scalability benchmarks set to deploy on at least 100 farms within the first year.\n\nImportance:\n\nWithout scalability, the project will face adoption barriers, limiting the potential impact on global farming practices. If the technology is too expensive or complex to deploy at scale, its potential for transformation in the agriculture industry will be drastically reduced.\n\nDelaying or failing to make the solution scalable would also prevent farmers from accessing affordable agritech tools, particularly those in regions with smaller or less tech-savvy farms.\n\nConsequences of Not Solving the Problem / Delaying Implementation:\n\nEconomic Losses for Farmers: Without the ability to predict crop yields, commodity prices, and input needs, farmers will face inefficient resource use, increasing operational costs and leading to lower profitability. If farmers cannot accurately assess their carbon credit eligibility, they miss out on additional revenue from carbon markets.\n\nEnvironmental Damage: The continued reliance on traditional farming methods (e.g., over-fertilization, inefficient water use) will exacerbate soil degradation, GHG emissions, and water pollution, undermining long-term farm productivity and contributing to climate change. Failure to adopt climate-smart practices could also result in farmers failing to meet regulatory standards, risking penalties and legal consequences.\n\nMissed Opportunities for Compliance and Carbon Trading: Without a solution for emissions tracking and carbon credit management, farmers could miss out on the growing carbon credit market, which is an essential revenue stream as environmental regulations become more stringent globally. Additionally, failure to comply with evolving emissions standards may cause them to lose market access or face penalties.\n\nStagnant Industry Growth: Agritech adoption is already lagging behind in many areas. If this project is delayed, it will hinder the progress of precision agriculture, which is necessary to improve efficiency, environmental stewardship, and profitability in the sector. The agriculture industry would continue to be highly vulnerable to climate risks without the necessary tools to enhance resilience and sustainability.\n\nIncreased Risk from Climate Change: As climate change accelerates, farmers will face more frequent and severe weather events, impacting crop yield and livestock health. Without advanced forecasting models, farmers cannot predict or mitigate these risks effectively, leaving them exposed to financial instability and production losses.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool. Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: 1.

They will also contribute to designing the UI/UX for farmers to interact with the data.\n\n3. Carbon Credit Calculation and Monetization Tool\n\nDescription: A tool integrated into the platform that calculates carbon credit eligibility based on the farm's GHG emissions (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O) and allows farmers to explore how to monetize these reductions through carbon credit trading.\n\nExpected Outcome: A calculator that automatically converts farm emissions into CO₂ equivalents (using IPCC protocols) and provides farmers with an estimate of their potential revenue from carbon credits. The tool will also include real-time updates to reflect changes in emissions or carbon credit market prices.\n\nRelevance for MLAs: Develop the algorithms for carbon credit conversion and integration with the platform’s emission-tracking system, and contribute to the development of data models that allow real-time monitoring of carbon credits.\n\n4.

is in place\nDoes the dataset contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII): False\nPlease describe how PII is handled or anonymized:: \nHow do you plan to evaluate the model or system’s performance?: Evaluating the Model/System Performance:\n\nTo ensure the system delivers actionable, reliable insights for farmers and agribusinesses, we'll employ a multi-faceted evaluation strategy that includes both quantitative and qualitative metrics. The evaluation process will combine traditional performance metrics, domain-specific business rules, and continuous monitoring to ensure alignment with business goals. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how we plan to evaluate the model/system’s performance:\n\n1. Golden Dataset & Benchmarking\n\nGolden Dataset:\n\nA golden dataset will be created from historical, manually validated data from select pilot farms. This dataset will serve as a \"truth\" set to compare the model’s predictions (e.g., fertilizer savings, yield forecasts, GHG reductions, carbon credits).\n\nThe golden dataset will include ground-truth data from historical soil nutrient levels, water usage, emissions data, crop yields, and market prices (for financial forecasting).\n\nBenchmark Set:\n\nWe will also use industry benchmark datasets where available, including national soil health standards, regional fertilizer efficiency benchmarks, and carbon credit eligibility guidelines. These benchmarks will serve to assess the regulatory compliance of the model's recommendations and results.\n\nCross-Validation:\n\nWe will employ k-fold cross-validation on training data to assess the robustness of the model across various farm environments, soil types, and crop varieties.\n\nSuccess Indicator: Model performance should match or exceed performance thresholds defined by these benchmark sets and golden datasets (e.g., 80%-90% accuracy in predictions of fertilizer savings and crop yield forecasting).\n\n2. Human-in-the-Loop Validation\n\nExpert Review:\n\nIn certain cases, particularly for complex predictions (e.g., emissions accounting, fertilizer optimization), agronomists or agriculture experts will manually validate the model's recommendations for individual farms. This will serve as a quality control process before recommendations are sent to farmers.\n\nFarmer Feedback:\n\nAfter deploying the model in a real-world environment, we will regularly gather feedback from farmers on the usability, accuracy, and practicality of the recommendations provided. This could include farmer surveys or direct interviews to understand how well the model's suggestions align with real-world farming practices.\n\nSuccess Indicator: Positive feedback from at least 80% of participating farmers on model accuracy and usability within the first 3-6 months of deployment.\n\n3. Heuristics and Business Rules\n\nBusiness Rules Integration:\n\nThe model will be designed to incorporate specific business rules and heuristics to ensure that the recommendations make sense in the context of real-world farming economics. For example:\n\nCost-Benefit Analysis: The system will calculate the ROI of reducing fertilizer inputs based on a farmer’s historical yields and input costs. It will reject recommendations that result in unfeasible or negative economic outcomes.\n\nRegulatory Compliance: For GHG emissions or fertilizer reductions, we will ensure that recommendations align with local environmental regulations (e.g., reducing nitrate runoff, adhering to carbon credit calculation methods).\n\nThreshold-based Alerts:\n\nThe system will set thresholds for certain key metrics (e.g., soil moisture levels, emissions) that trigger alerts or notifications if exceeded. These thresholds will be based on industry standards and internal model validations.\n\nSuccess Indicator: The model should consistently produce economically feasible recommendations that adhere to business rules (e.g., fertilizer savings should be in the range of 10-30% without sacrificing yield).\n\n4. Pre/Post Comparisons & Dashboards\n\nPre/Post Comparison:\n\nOne of the most important indicators of success is comparing pre-deployment and post-deployment farm data. Specifically, we will compare metrics such as:\n\nFertilizer use: Before vs. after model adoption to see if we’ve achieved input savings.\n\nCrop yield: Comparing actual yields vs. forecasted yields from the model.\n\nEmissions reductions: Pre/post carbon footprint analysis to assess whether GHG reductions are being achieved.\n\nFinancial Metrics:\n\nROI: Calculate the return on investment (ROI) from implementing the model’s recommendations. For example, the savings from reduced fertilizer inputs should ideally exceed the cost of implementing the model, leading to a positive ROI.\n\nCarbon Credit Revenue: If the system is successful in helping farms reduce emissions, we’ll track the number of carbon credits generated and their financial value.\n\nDashboards:\n\nA real-time dashboard will be used to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:\n\nFertilizer cost vs. savings\n\nYield forecasting accuracy\n\nGHG emissions levels and carbon credit eligibility\n\nWater usage efficiency and soil health\n\nDashboards will also allow farm managers to make quick decisions based on current data.\n\nSuccess Indicator: Positive pre/post comparisons, with at least 10-20% improvement in fertilizer use efficiency and crop yield accuracy within the first 6-12 months.\n\n5. Quantitative & Qualitative Metrics Tracking\n\nQuantitative Metrics:\n\nPrediction Accuracy: For metrics like yield forecasting, fertilizer savings, and emissions reductions, we will track the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or R-squared values for each prediction.\n\nCost Savings: We will calculate and track cost savings (e.g., in fertilizer and feed) in monetary terms as a percentage of the farm’s total annual input costs.\n\nGHG Reductions: Quantifying CO2e reductions based on fertilizer and livestock management changes.\n\nQualitative Metrics:\n\nFarmer Satisfaction: Regular surveys or feedback loops with farmers to gauge how well the system is meeting their needs. Metrics such as satisfaction with recommendations and ease of use will be tracked.\n\nAdoption Rate: The percentage of farmers who actively use and trust the system after the initial deployment period.\n\nSuccess Indicator: A positive balance of quantitative (e.g., cost savings, yield improvement) and qualitative feedback (e.g., farmer satisfaction > 80%, easy adoption rate).\n\n6. Continuous Monitoring and Retraining\n\nModel Drift Detection:\n\nOver time, the model will be continuously monitored for model drift (i.e., the performance degrading as farming conditions change). For example, if weather patterns shift or soil conditions change drastically, the model will need to be retrained to account for these new conditions.\n\nRetraining Process:\n\nThe model will undergo regular retraining with new data, either periodically (e.g., quarterly) or when significant changes (e.g., weather anomalies) are detected. This ensures that the model adapts to changes in farming practices and environmental conditions.\nHave you already explored or are you considering techniques associated with Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for this use case? If so, please specify which specific models or approaches used or are under consideration.: Yes, we are considering techniques like Generative AI for forecasting agricultural outputs and LLMs for automating insights generation from farm data. Specifically, we are exploring:\n\nGPT-based models (for text-based predictions and generating financial insights)\n\nBERT (for extracting key patterns from large agricultural datasets)\n\nTime-series forecasting models (for predicting commodity prices and crop yield trends)\nAre there any ethical, legal, or societal considerations related to the use of Generative AI or autonomous agents in this context? (e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): Yes, there are several ethical, legal, and societal considerations:\n\nData Privacy: Ensuring that all agricultural data, especially from farms, is anonymized and does not violate any privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) is crucial.\n\nTransparency: Clear communication is needed about how AI models generate forecasts and predictions, especially when making financial or environmental decisions.\n\nBias: We must ensure that the models do not favor specific crops, regions, or practices, which could lead to biased financial recommendations or uneven impacts on small-scale farmers.\n\nData Integrity: Accuracy of data inputs is critical, as errors in sensor data or model predictions could result in financial losses for farmers or incorrect sustainability reporting.\n\nAccountability: Users should understand who is accountable for model decisions, especially when AI-driven recommendations are applied in regulatory or financial contexts.\nHow will you measure success for this project? Please include any baseline metrics, KPIs, or qualitative outcomes you hope to observe.: Success for this project will be measured through the following metrics:\n\nQuantitative Metrics:\n\nForecast Accuracy: Achieving at least 85% accuracy in commodity price forecasts and crop yield predictions.\n\nReduction in Input Costs: Demonstrating a 10-15% reduction in fertilizer and feed costs through optimized recommendations.\n\nGHG Emissions Reduction: Quantifying at least a 10% reduction in methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions per farm, based on the AI-driven recommendations.\n\nKPIs:\n\nFarmer Adoption Rate: Targeting at least 50% adoption rate of the financial model by our current client base.\n\nRevenue from Carbon Credits: Help farmers generate at least $1 million in carbon credit revenue annually within the first 12 months.\n\nModel Efficiency: Reducing computational time for predictions by 30%, enabling real-time or near-real-time forecasting.\n\nQualitative Outcomes:\n\nFarmer Satisfaction: Achieving an NPS score of 40+ from users of the predictive platform.\n\nOperational Feedback: Receiving positive feedback from farmers about the usability and trustworthiness of the AI-driven insights.\nWhat infrastructure or platforms do you plan to use to support the development of this project?: Microsoft Azure, Company-hosted development environment (e.g., GitLab, JupyterHub), Open-source or public tools (e.g., Colab, Hugging Face, Weights & Biases)\nIn one or two sentences, describe the ideal MLA candidate for this project.: The ideal candidate for this project would have strong expertise in machine learning, particularly with time-series forecasting and predictive models, along with experience in agricultural data analysis, sensor data integration, and financial modeling.

    "qa_consolidated": "Project Summary: Describe the key business problem(s) or opportunity this project addresses. Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: Manufacturing operations and technical support of complex equipment face significant challenges in identifying and resolving production issues, quality defects, and equipment failures. Current root cause analysis (RCA) processes are time-consuming, require deep expertise, and often rely on manual investigation across disparate data sources.

These data sets combine videos of operators performing procedures from a first-person perspective, sensors and robots, maintenance records, incident reports, QA/QC reports, machine manuals and technical data sheets on equipment. The datasets provide the diversity needed to build an AI assistant that can perform across different manufacturing environments rather than being narrowly optimized for a single facility.\n\nThe sensor and equipment data includes time-series measurements of process parameters like temperature, pressure, flow rates, vibration, speed, and power consumption, along with equipment status indicators, alarm states, and operating modes.\n\nMaintenance records provide historical context essential for pattern recognition.

    "qa_consolidated": "Project Summary: Describe the key business problem(s) or opportunity this project addresses. Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: About Company 23's platform: Company 23's platform is an AI career navigation platform that helps people make better, faster career decisions. It unifies skills discovery, job matching, resume/cover-letter support, interview prep, and learning guidance into one conversational experience. We solve two chronic problems: (1) career services and employers can’t personalize guidance at scale; (2) learners lack a clear, adaptive path from goal → skill gap → practice → proof.\n\nThe opportunity. With Vector’s MLA support, we will build an agentic micro-learning engine that generates personalized, outcomes-aligned learning “sprints” from a learner’s career goal and skill gaps. Each sprint assembles bite-sized lessons with flashcards, audio snippets, quizzes, and practical tasks, then adapts based on performance and feedback. Content will be created and orchestrated by AI using a mixture of vetted web sources, licensed materials, and model knowledge, with safeguards for privacy, copyright, and safety.\n\nIndustry & audience. We operate at the intersection of workforce development, edtech, and HR tech. Primary customers: career hubs (postsecondary, newcomer/settlement and employment agencies), training providers, and employers; end users: students, newcomers, career changers, and displaced workers who need rapid, practical upskilling.\n\nMarket context. Canada faces simultaneous skills shortages and skills mismatches while services are capacity-constrained. Organizations are under pressure to demonstrate measurable outcomes and comply with PIPEDA/GDPR-style privacy, accessibility standards, and AI governance expectations. Generative/agentic AI now makes adaptive, mastery-based learning viable at population scale—if we can make it accurate, aligned, and safe.\n\nWhat we’ll build with MLA.\n\nAn agentic workflow that maps goals → competencies → curated micro-content → assessments → mastery signals, with automatic course packaging (cards, audio, quizzes).\n\nEvaluation loops (RLHF/RLAIF): capture learner and practitioner feedback to fine-tune prompts/policies and improve relevance, cultural fit, and accessibility.\n\nMeasurement & telemetry: item-level learning analytics, pre/post skill delta, engagement, and employability proxies (portfolio artifacts, interview pass-throughs).\n\nGuardrails: source attribution, deduplication, bias checks, and IP filters; privacy by design (data minimization, 2FA, encryption in transit/at rest).\n\nBusiness impact. For institutions and employers: lower cost per learner served, higher placement/readiness, and new evidence for funding and QA. For individuals: shorter time-to-competency, clearer paths to in-demand roles, and tangible artifacts that signal skills to employers. The MLA placement accelerates the science and engineering needed to move from static content to continuously improving, personalized learning at scale.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: Key Objectives, Success Milestones, and Importance\n\nObjectives (what this project will achieve)\n\nAutomate personalization at scale: Convert user goals and skill gaps into adaptive micro-courses (lessons, flashcards, audio, quizzes) with minimal human effort.\n\nClose the loop on learning efficacy: Instrument pre/post assessment and mastery signals so courses adapt in real time and continuously improve via RLHF/RLAIF.\n\nEnhance practitioner decision support: Surface clear readiness scores, top gaps, and suggested interventions to free practitioner capacity.\n\nHarden for trust & compliance: Bake in privacy-by-design, source attribution/IP filters, accessibility, and auditability suitable for public-sector/postsecondary use.\n\nLaunch a GTM-ready capability: Package the micro-learning engine as a deployable Company 23's platform module with APIs, partner playbooks, and pricing.\n\nSuccess Milestones (high level)\n\nPhase 1 — Foundation & Prototype: Goal→skills mapping, automated course assembly, basic adaptivity and telemetry proven in internal trials.\n\nPhase 2 — Pilot & Validation: Limited partner rollout demonstrating meaningful learning gains, practitioner time savings, and positive user/practitioner satisfaction.\n\nPhase 3 — Scale & Governance: Production hardening (security, IP controls, accessibility), partner implementation toolkit, and initial revenue-bearing deployments.\n\nImportance: consequences if delayed\n\nFor Company 23's platform\n\nMissed market window: Competitors ship agentic learning first; harder and costlier to differentiate later.\n\nPartner momentum stalls: Current interest from institutions/employers loses steam without a tangible, validated module.\n\nHigher unit costs: Manual content design persists; cost-per-learner remains too high to scale sustainably.\n\nFragmented product narrative: Company 23's platform remains guidance-heavy without the proof of learning impact funders increasingly require.\n\nTechnical debt accrues: Ad-hoc content features proliferate without a unified adaptive/feedback architecture.\n\nFor learners, practitioners, and the ecosystem\n\nCapacity crunch persists: Career services can’t personalize at scale; longer waitlists and lower completion.\n\nEquity gap widens: Youth, newcomers, and displaced workers wait longer for relevant upskilling tied to in-demand roles.\n\nOutcomes plateau: Fewer measurable skill gains and weaker employability signals (artifacts, badges, interview readiness).\n\nDuplicated effort & higher public spend: Agencies keep commissioning static content rather than leveraging reusable, adaptive modules.\n\nSlower workforce adaptation: Employers face prolonged skill mismatches, dampening productivity and growth.\n\nThis project moves Company 23's platform—and our partners—from static guidance to trusted, adaptive learning at scale, improving outcomes while reducing delivery costs.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool. Please describe what you expect the MLAs to help deliver within the scope of the cohort.: Expected Outputs & Deliverables (within MLA cohort scope)\n\n1) Functional prototype (end-to-end)\n\nAn agentic micro-learning flow that takes a user’s goal + skill gaps and auto-generates a short course “sprint” (5–10 lessons) with flashcards, audio (TTS), and quizzes.\n\nIn-product experience for a learner to take the sprint (cards → practice → quiz), plus basic adaptivity (easier/harder items based on performance).\n\n2) Developer-ready APIs & backend services\n\nCourse Assembly API: input (goals, skills, gaps) → output (lesson objects, flashcards, quiz items, audio asset refs).\n\nAssessment API: pre/post quiz generation, scoring, and item metadata.\n\nTelemetry API: capture events (time on task, attempts, confidence ratings) for analytics and RLHF.\n\nContent Validation API: source attribution, duplication checks, and IP/quality filters.\n\n3) Practitioner & admin dashboards (v1)\n\nPractitioner view: top gaps, readiness score, assigned sprints, learner progress, suggested interventions.\n\nAdmin view: content/source audit, safety flags, usage analytics, and configuration of guardrails.\n\n4) Evaluation & RLHF/RLAIF harness\n\nFeedback widgets (thumbs up/down + rationale) tied to items and lessons.\n\nData pipeline to aggregate signals and trigger prompt/policy updates; side-by-side A/B evaluation UI for human reviewers.\n\nMetrics bundle: pre→post deltas, completion, satisfaction, flagged-content rate.\n\n5) Trust, safety, and governance artifacts\n\nPrivacy-by-design controls (PII redaction, role-based access), source logs, IP filters, accessibility checks.\n\nRed-team test set and automated checks for factuality, bias, and prohibited content categories.\n\n6) Reusable content objects & schemas\n\nJSON schemas for lessons, flashcards, quizzes, hints, and rubrics.\n\nTemplated, brand-ready flashcard and quiz renderers; audio generation pipeline with storage references.\n\n7) Integration kit for Company 23's platform\n\nAdapter layer to plug the micro-learning module into existing Company 23's platform user profiles and skills models.\n\nWebhooks/events for “assign sprint,” “complete sprint,” and “update readiness.”\n\n8) Documentation & handoff\n\nSystem architecture and deployment guide; API reference; runbooks for monitoring and incident response.\n\nGTM-support packet: pilot playbook, sample KPIs dashboard, and a short demo script/video.\n\nWhat the MLAs will help deliver\n\nLead the design and implementation of the course assembly, assessment, telemetry, and validation APIs.\n\nBuild the evaluation/RLHF harness and the A/B review UI.\n\nStand up the first functional prototype (learner flow + practitioner/admin views) and baseline guardrails.\n\nProduce the schemas, docs, and runbooks needed for Company 23's platform to maintain and scale the module after the cohort.\nWho will be the primary users of this solution? Please identify key internal or external user groups (e.g., analysts, customers, clinicians, etc.).: Primary users include: (1) learners—students, newcomers, career changers, and displaced workers who complete adaptive micro-courses (lessons, flashcards, audio, quizzes) to close job-relevant skill gaps; (2) career practitioners/coaches at postsecondary and employment agencies who review diagnostics, assign learning sprints, and monitor progress; (3) program managers/administrators at partner institutions who oversee outcomes, configure guardrails/content sources, and report KPIs; (4) select employer partners who consume learner artifacts (badges, assessments, work samples) as signals of readiness; and (5) Company 23’s product/ML engineering team, which integrates the module, maintains telemetry, and operates the RLHF/RLAIF improvement loop and safety/compliance controls.\nHow will this solution integrate with your existing operations or product offerings?: Enhancement to an existing system\nPlease describe the dataset(s) you intend to use for this project.: Datasets\n\n1) Company 23's platform user profiles & goals (current, internal)\n\nWhat/Relevance: Pseudonymous learner profiles with target roles, declared skills, experience summaries—seed for goal→skills→content mapping.\n\nSource: User-generated in Company 23's platform.\n\nCollection/Format: Onboarding forms + chat;

~5–10 GB text + embeddings.\n\nPotential new datasets (to be confirmed during discovery)\n\nWe may identify additional needs during the cohort; examples include:\n\nSector-specific competency mappings (e.g., healthcare, advanced manufacturing) and deeper Canadian NOC alignments.\n\nAccessibility/readability annotations (reading-level datasets, alt-text patterns) to improve inclusive content generation.\n\nLicensed micro-content libraries (short videos, interactive items) where open content is insufficient.\n\nSafety/red-team test sets tailored to our domains (IP/attribution checks, PII patterns, hallucination/bias probes).\n\nOutcome signals from employer partners (e.g., internship screening results) to strengthen external validation, where feasible and consented.\n\nGovernance (applies across datasets): Pseudonymization by default, data minimization, opt-in research consent, encryption in transit/at rest, role-based access, audit logs; strict IP attribution and license compliance for external/partner content.\nWhat is the current state of readiness of this dataset?: Raw/unprocessed\nDoes the dataset contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII): False\nPlease describe how PII is handled or anonymized:: \nHow do you plan to evaluate the model or system’s performance?: To ensure the agentic micro-learning module is both effective and trustworthy, we’ll use a layered evaluation strategy that combines learning-science measures (pre/post gains), human review, small “golden” benchmark sets, product telemetry, and safety/IP guardrails. Success = measurable skill improvement for learners and reduced practitioner effort—without compromising privacy, accessibility, or attribution. We’ll lean on MLA guidance for benchmark design, difficulty calibration, and label quality to keep the approach statistically sound, equitable, and scalable.\n\nEvaluation Plan\n\n1) Golden sets & offline benchmarks (with MLA guidance)\nCreate small, versioned “golden” sets for 8–12 priority roles/skills (e.g., junior data analyst, customer success). Each includes source snippets, expected lesson/flashcard/quiz outputs, and common failure cases. Metrics: rubric scores (clarity, correctness, level fit, accessibility), semantic similarity to references, and citation checks.\n\n2) Human-in-the-loop validation\nPractitioners and internal reviewers rate generated items (1–5) on accuracy, level match, sector fit, usefulness; flag IP/attribution issues. Side-by-side A/B reviews of prompt/model/policy variants; track inter-rater agreement and sampling coverage.\n\n3) Pre/post learning efficacy\nAuto-generated pre/post quizzes aligned to the same objectives. Metrics: mean score delta (target ≥15%), effect size (Cohen’s d), two-week retention checks, and transfer proxies (short applied tasks). MLA input requested on blueprinting and light IRT calibration.\n\n4) Personalization & adaptivity quality\nTelemetry-based indicators: reduction in off-level items (target ≤10%), time-to-mastery curves, hint usage, abandon rates, and “stuck” loops. Segment by cohort (youth, newcomers, career changers) and by skill family to ensure equity.\n\n5) Safety, privacy & IP guardrails\nMaintain a red-team test suite for hallucinations, PII leakage, unsafe content, and license/attribution compliance. Track flagged-content rate (≤1%), time-to-remediation SLA, and zero-tolerance categories (0 incidents). Combine rule-based checks (regex/patterns) with model-based classifiers.\n\n6) Business & operational KPIs\nTime to generate a course sprint (<2 minutes, automated), practitioner time saved on plan creation (≥30%), course completion (≥70%), CSAT/effort scores (≥4.3/5, ≤2.5 CES), active learners per site, and cost-per-learner. Exposed via a live partner dashboard.\n\n7) Heuristics & business rules\nMinimum/maximum reading levels per cohort; objective coverage checks before publish; required citations for definitional content; automatic blocks if reviewer scores fall below threshold or attribution is missing.\n\n8) Online experiments (as traffic permits)\nGradual rollouts with A/B/n tests on prompts/models/policies. Primary outcomes: score delta uplift, completion, satisfaction; use sequential testing or CUPED-style variance reduction. Guardrails to prevent regressions on safety/IP metrics.\n\n9) Continuous improvement & governance\nWeekly eval run on golden sets plus sampled live items; regression reports; change-control that promotes only variants beating baselines on efficacy, safety, and cost. Versioned prompts, datasets, and metrics for auditability and reproducibility.\nHave you already explored or are you considering techniques associated with Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for this use case? If so, please specify which specific models or approaches used or are under consideration.: GPT-4o/4.1 (JSON-mode, function calling) for planning and structured generation; evaluated Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Haiku for long-context reasoning and safer drafting; and tested open models (e.g., Llama 3.1-70B, Mistral Large/Mixtral) behind a RAG layer when data residency/cost control are priorities. For retrieval we use pgvector/Supabase and Pinecone with text-embedding-3-large (and are evaluating Cohere/Voyage embeddings) plus a reranker (e.g., Cohere Rerank-3). The planned agentic pipeline will use multi-agent orchestration (LangGraph/LangChain): (1) Curriculum Planner → (2) Retriever (allow-listed/OER + partner LMI) → (3) Lesson/Flashcard/Quiz Generator (strict JSON schemas) → (4) Validator/Guardrails (citation/IP/reading-level/PII checks) → (5) Assessor/Adaptive Tuner (updates difficulty), all observable via LangSmith-style traces. For audio we’ll attach TTS (e.g., Azure Neural TTS/ElevenLabs) and optional ASR for spoken responses. Fine-tuning is scoped to light preference optimization (RLHF/RLAIF/DPO on our labels) rather than full model retrains; most gains will come from prompting, constrained decoding, tool use, and RAG. Hosting will be a mix of Azure OpenAI/Anthropic APIs and self/managed OSS where required for privacy, with policy enforcement (PII redaction, license filters) at the middleware layer. Overall maturity: production LLM features in Company 23's platform today; the agentic micro-learning system is at design/prototype stage, and the MLA cohort will help us harden retrieval, validation, and adaptive policies while selecting the best model mix for accuracy, cost, and compliance.\nAre there any ethical, legal, or societal considerations related to the use of Generative AI or autonomous agents in this context? (e.g., fairness, bias, data privacy, transparency, user trust): Yes—there are important ethical, legal, and societal considerations, and we’re designing the system to meet them.\n\nFairness & bias: Risk that content, assessments, or recommendations skew by gender, ethnicity, disability, immigration status, or language. Mitigations: allow-listed sources and sector-relevant OER; reviewer rubrics that score for bias/cultural fit; golden-set checks across user segments; difficulty/readability controls; ongoing disparate-impact monitoring (outcomes by cohort) with corrective actions.\n\nPrivacy & consent (PIPEDA/GDPR-aligned): We process personal data and learning telemetry. Mitigations: data minimization; opt-in consent for research; pseudonymization by default; encryption in transit/at rest; role-based access and audit logs; retention limits; configurable Canadian data residency via vendors where required.\n\nTransparency & explainability: Users and practitioners must understand why a course, item, or recommendation was generated. Mitigations: “Why this content?” disclosures; visible source attributions and licenses; model/version badges; practitioner-readable rationales for skill-gap and difficulty choices.\n\nIP & licensing: Assembling lessons from web content risks copyright violations. Mitigations: crawl from allow-listed, licensed, or open sources only; store license metadata; mandatory attribution; automated duplication/citation checks; hard blocks on unlicensed text in published items.\n\nAccessibility & inclusion (WCAG/AODA): Risk of excluding users with disabilities or lower literacy levels. Mitigations: WCAG 2.2 AA targets; TTS/audio alternatives; adjustable reading levels; captions/alt text; keyboard navigation; multilingual support in prioritized languages.\n\nAutonomy boundaries & user control: Agentic flows could act beyond user intent. Mitigations: explicit user approval gates for key actions; reversible changes; rate limits; event logs; easy “pause/undo”; no external communications or data writes without consent.\n\nHuman-in-the-loop & accountability: Over-automation can reduce trust and miss context. Mitigations: practitioners can review/override content, set guardrails, and flag issues; escalation paths; clear ownership for resolving safety/IP flags.\n\nEvaluation integrity & misuse: Generative tools could enable shortcutting or cheating. Mitigations: assessment variation pools; integrity checks (time-to-answer, item rotations); guidance that distinguishes practice aids vs. graded tasks; practitioner dashboards to spot anomalies.\n\nYouth & vulnerable populations: Additional safeguarding for minors and at-risk learners. Mitigations: age-appropriate filters, crisis-content safety checks, and referral guidance to human support when needed.\n\nSecurity & reliability: Model or pipeline failures can produce harmful or incorrect outputs. Mitigations: staged deployment, red-team test suites (hallucinations/PII/bias), automated guards with human review, incident response runbooks, and rollback policies.\n\nCommitment: We will document these controls (data flows, model cards, evaluation results), measure outcomes by cohort for equity, and involve practitioners in continuous review. Where trade-offs arise (e.g., personalization vs. privacy), we will default to user safety, consent, and transparency.\nHow will you measure success for this project? Please include any baseline metrics, KPIs, or qualitative outcomes you hope to observe.: Learning efficacy: Measure pre→post quiz gains per sprint (baseline TBD during pilot setup; target ≥15% mean score delta, Cohen’s d ≥0.5), 2-week retention quiz (baseline TBD; target ≥60% correct), and transfer proxies via short applied tasks (target ≥70% pass).\nPersonalization quality: Off-level item rate (baseline ~25–35% from current non-adaptive flows; target ≤10%); content relevance/fit ratings from learners/practitioners (baseline ~4.0/5; target ≥4.3/5); time-to-mastery curves improving across cohorts.\nPractitioner efficiency: Time to create a learning plan/micro-course (baseline ~45–60 min manually; target ≤5 min automated, ≤2 min operator time); perceived time saved (target ≥30%) and plan revision rate down (target −25%).\nAdoption & engagement: Sprint completion rate (baseline ~45–55% for comparable learning tasks; target ≥70%); active learners per site (target 150–300 in pilot), repeat sprint uptake (target ≥40%), weekly active practitioners (target ≥70% of assigned staff).\nSafety, IP, and privacy: Flagged-content rate (baseline TBD; target ≤1% with 100% remediated within SLA), zero known IP/license violations in sampled outputs, privacy test suite pass rate ≥95%, accessibility checks (WCAG 2.2 AA) ≥95% pass.\nEquity & inclusion: Outcome parity across key cohorts (youth, newcomers, career changers): gap in pre→post gains ≤5 pts; differential completion ≤7 pts; reading-level alignment ≥90%.\nCost & performance: Automated course generation time (target <2 min end-to-end), average inference cost per sprint (baseline TBD; target −30% vs. naive generation), system reliability ≥99.5% successful run rate.\nQualitative outcomes: Practitioner interviews indicating higher confidence in recommendations; learner comments citing clearer pathways and “right level” difficulty; partner testimonials suitable for case studies.\nProcess & governance: Weekly evaluation runs completed ≥90% of weeks; regression gates prevent shipping models that fail efficacy/safety thresholds; audit trail completeness ≥99%.\n\nBaseline notes: For measures marked “TBD,” we will capture a two-week baseline during Phase 1 using existing non-adaptive content flows and early micro-course prototypes, then lock targets for the remainder of the cohort.\nWhat infrastructure or platforms do you plan to use to support the development of this project?: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Internal on-premise or virtual private servers, Open-source or public tools (e.g., Colab, Hugging Face, Weights & Biases)\nIn one or two sentences, describe the ideal MLA candidate for this project.: The ideal candidate for this project would be a hands-on ML/LLM engineer with strong experience in prompt engineering, agentic workflow orchestration (e.g., LangGraph/LangChain), retrieval/RAG and reranking, evaluation design (golden sets, A/B tests), and light preference optimization (RLHF/RLAIF/DPO), comfortable building production-grade Python backends and APIs with vector databases and embeddings. Bonus points for familiarity with learning-science/assessment design, safety & governance (privacy/IP/accessibility), and integrating TTS/ASR, telemetry dashboards, and guardrails into end-to-end systems.\nPlease describe your technical team (if any). Include the number of staff and relevant roles (e.g., ML engineers, data analysts, product managers, etc.).: Technical team: A lean, cross-functional group of ~6–7 people (mix of core staff and contractors).\n\nProduct & Delivery: 1 Product Manager (Company 23's platform lead), 1 Project/Program Coordinator.\n\nEngineering: 2 Full-Stack Engineers (TypeScript/React, Node/Python), 1 Back-end Engineer.\n\nML/Data: 1 ML/LLM Engineer (prompting, RAG, evaluation)\n\nDesign & QA: 1 UX/UI Designer (accessibility, WCAG) and 1 QA Automation Contractor.\n\nSecurity/Compliance (fractional): 1 advisor supporting privacy-by-design, IP/licensing workflows, and readiness for ISO/SOC controls.\n\nThe team has shipped production LLM features in Company 23's platform (RAG, Agents, etc.) and can provide some support to the MLA  engineers. We do have gaps on true ML Engineers though as our current team is largely learned this as we build Company 23's platform and need help in particular on observability, evals, data pipelines, RLHF, and agentic workflows and frameworks.\nIs there any additional context or background information you would like to provide to help us evaluate your use case application?: Accomplishments to date: Company 23's platform has moved from concept to production with core LLM features for job/skill discovery, resume/cover letters, and interview prep. Through our FSC-backed pilots we’ve served 1,200+ learners, 50+ practitioners, and 15 partner organizations, integrating labour-market signals and skills taxonomies to deliver personalized guidance at scale. We’ve also shipped practitioner views (gap diagnostics, plan suggestions) and baseline telemetry for learning analytics, laying the groundwork for adaptive micro-learning.\n\nSupport & partnerships. We’ve received just under $1M in non-dilutive funding and partnered with ecosystem leaders (e.g., Magnet, CCDF, Ontario Chamber of Commerce, Serco and an LMI partner for Canadian demand data). These collaborations have provided access to priority pilot sites, domain expertise, and governance alignment (privacy, accessibility, and IP practices) that de-risk broader rollout.\n\nUser & practitioner feedback. Early pilots indicate strong product-market fit signals: job seekers/learners report greater career clarity and confidence, discover new role pathways, and value the actionable next steps. Practitioners highlight meaningful time savings potential on plan creation and better visibility into top skill gaps, enabling more time for high-impact coaching. Among requested enhancements—adaptive, bite-sized learning, clearer progress/mastery signals, and exportable artifacts for employers—directly inform this MLA project’s focus on agentic micro-learning and measurable outcomes.\n\nWe’re energized by the traction so far—and this MLA partnership is the next step toward delivering truly personalized, equitable career navigation at scale.\nUnnamed: 18: \nUnnamed: 19: \nUnnamed: 20: \nUnnamed: 21: \nUnnamed: 22: \nUnnamed: 23: \nUnnamed: 24: \nUnnamed: 25: \nUnnamed: 26: \nUnnamed: 27: \nUnnamed: 28: \nUnnamed: 29: \nUnnamed: 30: \nUnnamed: 31: \nUnnamed: 32: \nUnnamed: 33: \nUnnamed: 34: \nUnnamed: 35: \nUnnamed: 36: \nUnnamed: 37: \nUnnamed: 38: \nUnnamed: 39: \nUnnamed: 40: \nUnnamed: 41: \nUnnamed: 42: \nUnnamed: 43: "

Include your industry, target audience, and relevant market context (e.g., size, regulatory environment, etc.).: Company 24s tackles the lack of high-quality, family-friendly, and culturally authentic film content for the 1.9 billion Muslims and values-aligned families worldwide. Existing platforms either promote unsafe mass content or low-budget niche alternatives. Company 24s bridges this gap using AI to power script-to-teaser generation, multilingual voice-preserving dubbing, and values-based content moderation—helping creators develop, validate, and fund films faster and more affordably.\n\nOperating at the intersection of AI, media, and community finance, Company 24s enables creators to attract investment through compliant equity crowdfunding while giving audiences a voice in what gets produced.

By blending ethical AI innovation with scalable storytelling, Company 24s creates a new creative economy that empowers creators, investors, and audiences—redefining how authentic stories are developed, localized, and distributed globally.\nWhat are the key objectives and success milestones of the proposed solution (e.g., automate a manual process, build a new product, improve decision support) and its importance (consequences of not solving the problem/what would happen if this project is delayed or not implemented)?: Company 24s’ key objective is to build an AI-powered platform that democratizes film development, funding, and distribution for family-friendly, culturally authentic content. The solution automates and enhances traditionally manual, expensive, and biased creative processes—using AI for script-to-teaser generation, voice-preserving multilingual dubbing, and values-based content moderation. These tools drastically reduce time and cost from concept to validation while ensuring cultural and ethical integrity.\n\nSuccess milestones include:\n\nMVP launch of the AI Script→Teaser tool (validate 500+ creator projects).\n\nPublic beta of the streaming and voting platform with 10–15 greenlit films.\n\nFull deployment of multilingual dubbing across 10+ languages.\n\n100K+ active users and global partnerships with film funds and cultural organizations.\n\nIf this project is delayed, the gap in safe, values-aligned entertainment will continue to widen—leaving 1.9B Muslims underserved, creators underfunded, and audiences reliant on misaligned or low-quality content. Traditional studios will retain control over cultural narratives, and Canada will miss the opportunity to lead in ethical AI media innovation, a fast-emerging sector blending creative technology, community engagement, and responsible AI use.\nWhat specific outputs or deliverables do you envision for this project? Examples may include: a functional prototype, API, dashboard, chatbot, backend system, pipeline, or internal tool.
