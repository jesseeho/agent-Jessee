A well-scoped and aligned use case sets the foundation for efficient solution design and minimizes ambiguity during execution."

Includes whether the data is structured, representative, privacy-compliant, and ready to be shared with an MLA for development purposes. Without suitable data, even well-defined use cases cannot be realized."
